And it is available forever. This is known by GitHub, and intentionally designed that way.\n\nThis is such an enormous attack vector for all organizations that use GitHub that we\u2019re introducing a new term: **Cross Fork Object Reference (CFOR)**. A CFOR vulnerability occurs when one repository fork can access sensitive data from another fork (including data from private and deleted forks). Similar to an Insecure Direct Object Reference, in CFOR users supply commit hashes to directly access commit data that otherwise would not be visible to them.\n\nLet\u2019s see a few examples.\n\nAccessing Deleted Fork Data\n---------------------------\n\nConsider this common workflow on GitHub:\u00a0\n\n1.  You fork a public repository\n    \n2.  You commit code to your fork\n    \n3.  You delete your fork\n    \n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/msknWhH1EkTt7PchLIRCt3npCI.png)\n\nIs the code you committed to the fork still accessible? It shouldn\u2019t be, right? You deleted it.\n\nIt is. And it\u2019s accessible forever. Out of your control.\u00a0\n\nIn the video below, you\u2019ll see us fork a repository, commit data to it, delete the fork, and then access the \u201cdeleted\u201d commit data via the original repository.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n**You might think you\u2019re protected by needing to know the commit hash. You\u2019re not. The hash is discoverable. More on that later.**\n\n#### How often can we find data from deleted forks?\n\nPretty often. We surveyed a few (literally 3) commonly-forked public repositories from a large AI company and easily found 40 valid API keys from deleted forks. The user pattern seemed to be this:\n\n1.  Fork the repo.\n    \n2.  Hard-code an API key into an example file.\u00a0\n    \n3.  <Do Work>\n    \n4.  Delete the fork.\n    \n      \n    \n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/CIeHAgW971XDzRy61aiZjY8fBqE.png)\n\n  \n\n**But this gets worse, it works in reverse too:**\u00a0\n\nAccessing Deleted Repo Data\n---------------------------\n\nConsider this scenario:\n\n1.  You have a public repo on GitHub.\n    \n2.  A user forks your repo.\n    \n3.  You commit data after they fork it (and they never sync their fork with your updates).\n    \n4.  You delete the entire repo.\n    \n      \n    \n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/A7rA45DJNYSMUEPCF6tj4wilVC0.png)\n\nIs the code you committed after they forked your repo still accessible?\n\nYep.\n\nGitHub stores repositories and forks in a [repository network](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-permissions-and-visibility-of-forks#about-visibility-of-forks)\n, with the original \u201cupstream\u201d repository acting as the root node. [When a public \u201cupstream\u201d repository that has been forked is \u201cdeleted\u201d, GitHub reassigns the root node role to one of the downstream forks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/what-happens-to-forks-when-a-repository-is-deleted-or-changes-visibility#deleting-a-public-repository)\n. However, all of the commits from the \u201cupstream\u201d repository still exist and are accessible via any fork.\n\n  \n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/jCEeyZLP33ugahiS5Oc3N9ms.png)\n\n  \n\nIn the video below, we create a repo, fork it and then show how data not synced with the fork can still be accessed by the fork after the original repo is deleted.\n\n  \n\n  \n\nThis isn\u2019t just some weird edge case scenario. This unfolded last week:\n\n_I submitted a P1 vulnerability to a major tech company showing they accidentally committed a private key for an employee\u2019s GitHub account that had significant access to their entire GitHub organization. They immediately deleted the repository, but since it had been forked, I could still access the commit containing the sensitive data via a fork, despite the fork never syncing with the original \u201cupstream\u201d repository._\n\nThe implication here is that any code committed to a public repository may be accessible _forever_ as long as there is at least one fork of that repository.\n\n**It gets worse.**\n\nAccessing Private Repo Data\n---------------------------\n\nConsider this common workflow for open-sourcing a new tool on GitHub:\n\n1.  You create a private repo that will eventually be made public.\n    \n2.  You create a private, internal version of that repo (via forking) and commit additional code for features that you\u2019re not going to make public.\n    \n3.  You make your \u201cupstream\u201d repository public and keep your fork private.\n    \n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/xImmfuPpiSy9ttCvAMC5G46bGSk.png)\n\nAre your private features and related code (from step 2) viewable by the public?\n\nYes. Any code committed between the time you created an internal fork of your tool and when you open-sourced the tool, those commits are accessible on the public repository.\u00a0\n\nAny commits made to your private fork _after_ you make the \u201cupstream\u201d repository public are not viewable. That\u2019s because changing the visibility of a private \u201cupstream\u201d repository results in two repository networks - one for the private version, and one for the public version.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/zOeORJBOu7eK4cx0y2qdgtXNW4.png)\n\nIn the video below, we demonstrate how organizations open-source new tools while maintaining private internal forks, and then show how someone could access commit data from the private internal version via the public one.\n\n  \n\n  \n\nUnfortunately, this workflow is one of the most common approaches users and organizations take to developing open-source software. As a result, it\u2019s possible that confidential data and secrets are inadvertently being exposed on an organization's public GitHub repositories.\n\n  \n\nHow do you actually access the data?\n------------------------------------\n\nBy directly accessing the commit.\n\nDestructive actions in GitHub\u2019s repository network (like the 3 scenarios mentioned above) remove references to commit data from the standard GitHub UI and normal git operations. However, this data still exists and is accessible (if you know the commit hash). This is the tie-in between CFOR and IDOR vulnerabilities - if you know the commit hash you can directly access data that is not intended for you.\n\nCommit hashes are SHA-1 values.\n\n  \n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/EoVCvCLjHvZJCuMrrZ0ZwQd3W8M.png)\n\n  \n\nIf a user knows the SHA-1 commit hash of a particular commit they want to see, they can directly navigate to that commit at the endpoint: https://github.com`/<user/org>/<repo>/commit/<commit_hash>`. They\u2019ll see a yellow banner explaining that \u201c\\[t\\]his commit does not belong to any branch of this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.\u201d\n\n  \n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/B0wRJU4mjHvmKdy7mpZ3Z3wRV8.png)\n\n  \n\n**Where do you get these hash values?**\n\nCommit hashes can be brute forced through GitHub\u2019s UI, particularly because the git protocol permits the use of [short SHA-1 values](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Revision-Selection#:~:text=to%20any%20commit.-,Short%20SHA%2D1,-Git%20is%20smart)\n when referencing a commit. A short SHA-1 value is the minimum number of characters required to avoid a collision with another commit hash, with an absolute minimum of 4. The keyspace of all 4 character SHA-1 values is 65,536 (16^4). Brute forcing all possible values can be achieved relatively easily.\u00a0\n\nFor example, consider this commit in TruffleHog\u2019s repository:\n\n  \n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/yPbRdgv9LoasW1BXLK09dZNMSXs.png)\n\n  \n\nTo access this commit, users typically visit the URL containing the full SHA-1 commit hash: [https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/commit/07f01e8337c1073d2c45bb12d688170fcd44c637](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/commit/07f01e8337c1073d2c45bb12d688170fcd44c637)\n\nBut users don\u2019t need to know the entire 32 character SHA-1 value, they only need to correctly guess the Short SHA-1 value, which in this case is `07f01e`.\n\n  \n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/jji5JQSyL5Bh0OJtpMQDB65DE.png)\n\n[https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/commit/07f01e](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/commit/07f01e)\n\nBut what\u2019s more interesting; GitHub exposes a public events API endpoint. You can also query for commit hashes in the [events archive](https://www.gharchive.org/)\n which is managed by a 3rd party, and saves all GitHub events for the past decade outside of GitHub, even after the repos get deleted.\n\nGitHub\u2019s Policies\n-----------------\n\nWe recently submitted our findings to GitHub via their VDP program. This was their response:\n\n  \n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/G9xGKRx7gPHauxianQClKVxPE.png)\n\n  \n\nAfter reviewing the documentation, it\u2019s clear as day that GitHub designed repositories to work like this.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/eE6IuZrodHY2R0pBWcGHKPNxI.png)\n\n  \n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/UpywoiGAzxzDtqcMAzLxKeW6dwQ.png)\n\n[https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/what-happens-to-forks-when-a-repository-is-deleted-or-changes-visibility](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/what-happens-to-forks-when-a-repository-is-deleted-or-changes-visibility)\n\nWe appreciate that GitHub is transparent about their architecture and has taken the time to clearly document what users should expect to happen in the instances documented above.\u00a0\n\nOur issue is this:\n\nThe average user views the separation of private and public repositories as a security boundary, and understandably believes that any data located in a private repository cannot be accessed by public users. Unfortunately, as we documented above, that is not always true. Whatsmore, the act of deletion implies the destruction of data. As we saw above, deleting a repository or fork does not mean your commit data is actually deleted.\n\nImplications\n------------\n\nWe have a few takeaways from this:\n\n1.  **As long as one fork exists, any commit to that repository network (ie: commits on the \u201cupstream\u201d repo or \u201cdownstream\u201d forks) will exist forever.**\n    \n    1.  This further cements our view that the only way to securely remediate a leaked key on a public GitHub repository is through key rotation. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time documenting how to rotate keys for the most popularly leaked secret types - check our work out here: [howtorotate.com](https://howtorotate.com/docs/introduction/getting-started/)\n        .\n        \n\n2.  GitHub\u2019s repository architecture necessitates these design flaws and unfortunately, the vast **majority of GitHub users will never understand how a repository network actually works and will be less secure** because of it.\n    \n\n3.  As secret scanning evolves, and we can hopefully scan all commits in a repository network, **we\u2019ll be alerting on secrets that might not be our own** (ie: they might belong to someone who forked a repository). This will require more diligent triaging.\n    \n      \n    \n4.  While these three scenarios are shocking, that doesn\u2019t even cover all of the ways GitHub could be storing deleted data from your repositories. Check out our [recent post](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/trufflehog-scans-deleted-git-branches)\n     (and related TruffleHog update) about how you also need to scan for secrets in deleted branches.\u00a0\n    \n\nFinally, while our research focused on GitHub, it\u2019s important to note that some of these issues exist on other version control system products.\n\n[More from THE DIG](../blog)\n\n-----------------------------\n\nThoughts, research findings, reports, and more from Truffle Security Co.\n\n[![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/QBddtt3Ue3SLvfEshNFBiR49U8I.png)\\\n\\\nJul 24, 2024\\\n\\\n###### Anyone can Access Deleted and Private Repository Data on GitHub](./anyone-can-access-deleted-and-private-repo-data-github)\n[![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/RzhOgFezeS2FiUsX9xpXnD2FeJk.png)\\\n\\\nJul 19, 2024\\\n\\\n###### Secrets in Source Code Are Not A Code Security Problem](./secrets-are-not-a-code-security-problem)\n[![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/rrJ69uUorA9UCMKRYcf3E2xo1kc.png)\\\n\\\nJul 10, 2024\\\n\\\n###### Leaked Secrets in Public Jenkins Logs](./leaked-secrets-in-public-jenkins-logs)\n\n[T](../blog)\nhe Dig\n===================\n\nThoughts, research findings, reports, and more from Truffle Security Co.\n\n[![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/QBddtt3Ue3SLvfEshNFBiR49U8I.png)\\\n\\\nJul 24, 2024\\\n\\\n###### Anyone can Access Deleted and Private Repository Data on GitHub](./anyone-can-access-deleted-and-private-repo-data-github)\n[![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/RzhOgFezeS2FiUsX9xpXnD2FeJk.png)\\\n\\\nJul 19, 2024\\\n\\\n###### Secrets in Source Code Are Not A Code Security Problem](./secrets-are-not-a-code-security-problem)\n\nSTAY STRONG\n\nDIG DEEP\n\n[](../)\n\nTRUFFLEHOG\n\n[TruffleHog open-source](../trufflehog)\n\n[TruffleHog enterprise](../trufflehog-enterprise)\n\n[Forager](https://forager.trufflesecurity.com/)\n\nNEW!\n\n[Security](../security)\n\n[Integrations](../integrations)\n\n[Pricing](../pricing)\n\n[CUSTOMERS](../customers)\n\nCOMPANY\n\n[About](../about)\n\n[Careers](../careers)\n\n[Press](../press)\n\n[FAQ](../faq)\n\n[Contact us](../contact)\n\nRESOURCES\n\n[Blog](../blog)\n\n[Content library](../content-library)\n\n[Events](../events)\n\n[Videos](../videos)\n\n[GitHub](https://github.com/trufflesecurity)\n\n[Enterprise docs](https://docs.trufflesecurity.com/)\n\n[Open-source docs](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog#trufflehog)\n\n[How to rotate](https://howtorotate.com/)\n\nNEW!\n\nDOING IT THE RIGHT WAY\n\nSINCE 2021\n\n[](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/)\n[](https://www.linkedin.com/company/trufflesecurity)\n[](https://www.youtube.com/@TruffleSecurity)\n[](https://twitter.com/trufflesec)\n\n[#trufflehog-community](https://join.slack.com/t/trufflehog-community/shared_invite/zt-pw2qbi43-Aa86hkiimstfdKH9UCpPzQ)\n[#Secret Scanning](https://discord.gg/8Hzbrnkr7E)\n\n\u00a9 2024 Truffle Security Co.\n\n[Privacy policy](../privacy-policy)\n\n[Terms and conditions](../terms-conditions)\n\n[Data processing agreement](../data-processing-agreement)\n\n[Acceptable use policy](../acceptable-use-policy)\n\nSTAY STRONG\n\nDIG DEEP\n\n[](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/)\n[](https://www.linkedin.com/company/trufflesecurity)\n[](https://www.youtube.com/@TruffleSecurity)\n[](https://twitter.com/trufflesec)\n\n[#trufflehog-community](https://join.slack.com/t/trufflehog-community/shared_invite/zt-pw2qbi43-Aa86hkiimstfdKH9UCpPzQ)\n[#Secret Scanning](https://discord.gg/8Hzbrnkr7E)\n\n\u00a9 2024 Truffle Security Co.\n\n[Privacy policy](../privacy-policy)\n\n[Terms and conditions](../terms-conditions)\n\n[Data processing agreement](../data-processing-agreement)\n\n[Acceptable use policy](../acceptable-use-policy)\n\n-----\nGenerate comments in a hierarchical structure with 3 comments per level, up to a depth of 3."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n- **andersa** (): I reported this on their HackerOne many years ago (2018 it seems) and they said it was working as intended. Conclusion: don&#x27;t use private forks. Copy the repository instead.<p>Here is their full response from back then:<p>&gt; Thanks for the submission! We have reviewed your report and validated your findings. After internally assessing the finding we have determined it is a known low risk issue. We may make this functionality more strict in the future, but don&#x27;t have anything to announce now. As a result, this is not eligible for reward under the Bug Bounty program.<p>&gt; GitHub stores the parent repository along with forks in a &quot;repository network&quot;. It is a known behavior that objects from one network member are readable via other network members. Blobs and commits are stored together, while refs are stored separately for each fork. This shared storage model is what allows for pull requests between members of the same network. When a repository&#x27;s visibility changes (Eg. public-&gt;private) we remove it from the network to prevent private commits&#x2F;blobs from being readable via another network member.\n  - **SnowflakeOnIce** (): There seems to be no such thing as a &quot;private fork&quot; on GitHub in 2024 [1]:<p>&gt; A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the upstream repository. All forks of public repositories are public. You cannot change the visibility of a fork.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;pull-requests&#x2F;collaborating-with-pull-requests&#x2F;working-with-forks&#x2F;about-permissions-and-visibility-of-forks#about-visibility-of-forks\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;pull-requests&#x2F;collaborating-with-...</a>\n    - **ff7c11** (): A fork of a private repo is private. When you make the original repo public, the fork is still a private repo, but the commits can now be accessed by hash.\n    - **itsgabriel** (): Funnily enough the docs are wrong, the GitHub CLI allows changing a forks visibility <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;78094654&#x2F;12846952\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;78094654&#x2F;12846952</a>\n    - **rkagerer** (): Am I the only one who finds this conceptually confusing?\n  - **liendolucas** (): Honest question. Submitting these types of bugs only to get a: &quot;we have determined it is known low risk issue...&quot; seems like they really don&#x27;t want to pay for someone else&#x27;s time and dedication in making their product safer. If they knew about this, was this disclosed somewhere? If not I don&#x27;t see them playing a fair game. What&#x27;s the motivation to do this if in the end they can have the final decision to award you or not? To me it looks like similar to what happens with Google Play&#x2F;Apple store to decide whether or not an app can be uploaded&#x2F;distributed through them.<p>Edit: I popped this up because to me is absolutely miserable from a big company to just say: &quot;Thanks, but we were aware of this&quot;.\n    - **jonahx** (): Not defending GH here (their position is indefensible imo) but, as the article notes, they document these behaviors clearly and publicly:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;pull-requests&#x2F;collaborating-with-pull-requests&#x2F;working-with-forks&#x2F;what-happens-to-forks-when-a-repository-is-deleted-or-changes-visibility\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;pull-requests&#x2F;collaborating-with-...</a><p>I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re being underhanded exactly... they&#x27;re just making a terrible decision.

Unfortunately, as we documented above, that is not always true. Whatsmore, the act of deletion implies the destruction of data. As we saw above, deleting a repository or fork does not mean your commit data is actually deleted.\n    - **tptacek** (): No large company running a bug bounty cares one iota about stiffing you on a bounty payment. The teams running this programs are internally incentivized to <i>maximize</i> payouts; the payouts are evidence that the system is working. If you&#x27;re denied a payment --- for a large company, at least --- there&#x27;s something else going on.<p>The thing to keep in mind is that large-scale bug bounty programs make their own incentive weather. People game the hell out of them. If you ack and fix sev:info bugs, people submit <i>lots</i> more sev:info bugs, and now your security program has been reoriented around the dumbest bugs --- the opposite of what you want a bounty program to do.\n    - **kayodelycaon** (): As the article pointed out, GitHub already publicly documented this vulnerability.<p>My employer doesn&#x27;t pay out for known security issues, especially if we have mitigating controls.<p>A lot of people spam us with vulnerability reports from security tools we already use. At least half of them turn out to be false positives we are already aware of. In my opinion, running a bug bounty program at all is a net negative for us. We aren&#x27;t large enough to get the attention of anyone competent.\n  - **tedivm** (): I reported a different security issue to github, and they responded the same (although they ultimately ended up fixing it when I told them I was going to blog about the &quot;intended behavior&quot;).\n    - **myfonj** (): What &quot;intended behaviour&quot; was that, specifically?\n    - **_heimdall** (): Did you end up getting a bug bounty out of it?\n- **hackerbirds** (): Users should never be expected to know these gotchas for a feature called &quot;private&quot;, documented or not. It&#x27;s disappointing to see GitHub calling it a feature instead of a bug, to me it just shows a complete lack of care about security.

Even if gitlab lacks those things curently (but I think for example it does support short hashes), it&#x27;s easy to imagine them showing up somehow retroactively.<p>If you&#x27;re just agreeing with the grandparent post that github&#x27;s naming (&quot;private&quot;) is misleading or that the fork feature encourages this mistake: agreed.<p>Curious to know if any git hosting service does support gc-ing under user control.\n    - **account42** (): &gt; if I want to host something private, I will choose another vendor.<p>Or you know, self-host, preferrably on-prem.<p>Basic git hosting only needs a sshd running on the server.

Otherwise have to audit every previous commit and every commit on every fork of your private code.\n    - **umpalumpaaa** (): If I understand the issue correctly if you make the original repo public any private forks from other users are also effectively public. Right?\n    - **IshKebab** (): Yeah that&#x27;s fine but the issue is GitHub doesn&#x27;t make it clear that you need to do this.\n  - **kemitche** (): I agree. The other cases may be mildly surprising, but ultimately fall firmly into the category of &quot;once public on the internet, always public.&quot; Deleting a repo or fork or commit doesn&#x27;t revoke an access key that was accidentally committed, and an access key being public for even a microsecond should be assumed to have been scraped and usable by a malicious actor.\n    - **hmottestad** (): If you have a private repo, you would assume that nothing in that private repo becomes public unless you do something very explicit.<p>The issue here is that if you have a private repo and a private fork of that repo.

But current AI systems still struggle with solving general math problems because of limitations in reasoning skills and training data.\n\nToday, we present AlphaProof, a new reinforcement-learning based system for formal math reasoning, and AlphaGeometry 2, an improved version of our [geometry-solving system](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphageometry-an-olympiad-level-ai-system-for-geometry/)\n. Together, these systems solved four out of six problems from this year\u2019s [International Mathematical Olympiad](https://www.imo2024.uk/)\n (IMO), achieving the same level as a silver medalist in the competition for the first time.\n\nBreakthrough AI performance solving complex math problems\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe IMO is the oldest, largest and most prestigious competition for young mathematicians, held annually since 1959.\n\nEach year, elite pre-college mathematicians train, sometimes for thousands of hours, to solve six exceptionally difficult problems in algebra, combinatorics, geometry and number theory. Many of the winners of the [Fields Medal](https://www.mathunion.org/imu-awards/fields-medal)\n, one of the highest honors for mathematicians, have represented their country at the IMO.\n\nMore recently, the annual IMO competition has also become widely recognised as a grand challenge in machine learning and an aspirational benchmark for measuring an AI system\u2019s advanced mathematical reasoning capabilities.\n\nThis year, we applied our combined AI system to the competition problems, provided by the IMO organizers. Our solutions were scored according to the IMO\u2019s point-awarding rules by prominent mathematicians [Prof Sir Timothy Gowers](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~wtg10/)\n, an IMO gold medalist and Fields Medal winner, and [Dr Joseph Myers](https://www.polyomino.org.uk/)\n, a two-time IMO gold medalist and Chair of the IMO 2024 Problem Selection Committee.\n\n> \u201c\n> \n> The fact that the program can come up with a non-obvious construction like this is very impressive, and well beyond what I thought was state of the art.\n\nProf Sir Timothy Gowers,  \nIMO gold medalist and Fields Medal winner\n\nFirst, the problems were manually translated into formal mathematical language for our systems to understand. In the official competition, students submit answers in two sessions of 4.5 hours each. Our systems solved one problem within minutes and took up to three days to solve the others.\n\nAlphaProof solved two algebra problems and one number theory problem by determining the answer and proving it was correct. This included the hardest problem in the competition, solved by only five contestants at this year\u2019s IMO. AlphaGeometry 2 proved the geometry problem, while the two combinatorics problems remained unsolved.\n\nEach of the six problems can earn seven points, with a total maximum of 42. Our system achieved a final score of 28 points, earning a perfect score on each problem solved \u2014 equivalent to the top end of the [silver-medal category](https://www.imo-official.org/year_info.aspx?year=2024)\n. This year, the gold-medal threshold starts at 29 points, and was achieved by [58 of 609 contestants](https://www.imo-official.org/year_individual_r.aspx?year=2024)\n at the official competition.\n\n ![Colored graph showing our AI system\u2019s performance relative to human competitors earning bronze, silver and gold at IMO 2024.

We earned 28 out of 42 total points, achieving the same level as a silver medalist in the competition.\n\nAlphaProof: a formal approach to reasoning\n------------------------------------------\n\nAlphaProof is a system that trains itself to prove mathematical statements in the formal language [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/)\n. It couples a pre-trained language model with the [AlphaZero](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphazero-shedding-new-light-on-chess-shogi-and-go/)\n reinforcement learning algorithm, which previously taught itself how to master the games of chess, shogi and Go.\n\nFormal languages offer the critical advantage that proofs involving mathematical reasoning can be formally verified for correctness. Their use in machine learning has, however, previously been constrained by the very limited amount of human-written data available.\n\nIn contrast, natural language based approaches can hallucinate plausible but incorrect intermediate reasoning steps and solutions, despite having access to orders of magnitudes more data. We established a bridge between these two complementary spheres by fine-tuning a [Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction)\n model to automatically translate natural language problem statements into formal statements, creating a large library of formal problems of varying difficulty.\n\nWhen presented with a problem, AlphaProof generates solution candidates and then proves or disproves them by searching over possible proof steps in Lean. Each proof that was found and verified is used to reinforce AlphaProof\u2019s language model, enhancing its ability to solve subsequent, more challenging problems.\n\nWe trained AlphaProof for the IMO by proving or disproving millions of problems, covering a wide range of difficulties and mathematical topic areas over a period of weeks leading up to the competition. The training loop was also applied during the contest, reinforcing proofs of self-generated variations of the contest problems until a full solution could be found.\n\n ![Process infographic of AlphaProof\u2019s reinforcement learning training loop: Around one million informal math problems are translated into a formal math language by a formalizer network.

Then a solver network searches for proofs or disproofs of the problems, progressively training itself via the AlphaZero algorithm to solve more challenging problems.\n\nA more competitive AlphaGeometry 2\n----------------------------------\n\nAlphaGeometry 2 is a significantly improved version of [AlphaGeometry](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphageometry-an-olympiad-level-ai-system-for-geometry/)\n. It\u2019s a neuro-symbolic hybrid system in which the language model was based on [Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction)\n and trained from scratch on an order of magnitude more synthetic data than its predecessor. This helped the model tackle much more challenging geometry problems, including problems about movements of objects and equations of angles, ratio or distances.\n\nAlphaGeometry 2 employs a symbolic engine that is two orders of magnitude faster than its predecessor. When presented with a new problem, a novel knowledge-sharing mechanism is used to enable advanced combinations of different search trees to tackle more complex problems.\n\nBefore this year\u2019s competition, AlphaGeometry 2 could solve 83% of all historical IMO geometry problems from the past 25 years, compared to the 53% rate achieved by its predecessor. For IMO 2024, AlphaGeometry 2 [solved Problem 4](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/Blog/imo-2024-solutions/P4/index.html)\n within 19 seconds after receiving its formalization.\n\n ![A geometric diagram featuring a triangle ABC inscribed in a larger circle, with various points, lines, and another smaller circle intersecting the triangle.

AlphaGeometry 2 proposed to construct E, a point on the line BI so that \u2220AEB = 90\u00b0. Point E helps give purpose to the midpoint L of AB, creating many pairs of similar triangles such as ABE ~ YBI and ALE ~ IPC needed to prove the conclusion.\n\nNew frontiers in mathematical reasoning\n---------------------------------------\n\nAs part of our IMO work, we also experimented with a natural language reasoning system, built upon [Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction)\n and our latest research to enable advanced problem-solving skills. This system doesn\u2019t require the problems to be translated into a formal language and could be combined with other AI systems. We also tested this approach on this year\u2019s IMO problems and the results showed great promise.\n\nOur teams are continuing to explore multiple AI approaches for advancing mathematical reasoning and plan to release more technical details on AlphaProof soon.\n\nWe\u2019re excited for a future in which mathematicians work with AI tools to explore hypotheses, try bold new approaches to solving long-standing problems and quickly complete time-consuming elements of proofs \u2014 and where AI systems like [Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction)\n become more capable at math and broader reasoning.\n\n-----\nGenerate comments in a hierarchical structure with 3 comments per level, up to a depth of 3."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n- **Smaug123** (): So I am extremely hyped about this, but it&#x27;s not clear to me how much heavy lifting this sentence is doing:<p>&gt; First, the problems were manually translated into formal mathematical language for our systems to understand.<p>The non-geometry problems which were solved were all of the form &quot;Determine all X such that\u2026&quot;, and the resulting theorem statements are all of the form &quot;We show that the set of all X is {foo}&quot;.

I <i>want</i> to believe that the computer found it, but I can&#x27;t find anything to confirm. Anyone know?\n  - **ocfnash** (): The computer did find the answers itself. I.e., it found &quot;even integers&quot; for P1, &quot;{1,1}&quot; for P2, and &quot;2&quot; for P6. It then also provided provided a Lean proof in each case.\n    - **freehorse** (): It would make a lot of sense for the lean-code-formalisation of the problems done by the researchers fed to the AI to be provided. Not assuming bad intent in not providing them, but it would help understand better the results.\n    - **nnarek** (): formal definition of first theorem already contain answer of the problem \n&quot;{\u03b1 : \u211d | \u2203 k : \u2124, Even k \u2227 \u03b1 = k}&quot; (which mean set of even real numbers).if they say that they have translated first problem into formal definition then it is very interesting how they initially formalized problem without including answer in it\n    - **Davidzheng** (): Can you elaborate on how it makes guesses like this? Does it do experiments before? Is it raw LLM? Is it feedback loop based on partial progress?\n  - **summerlight** (): To speak generally, that translation part is <i>much</i> easier than the proof part. The problem with automated translation is that the translation result might be incorrect. This happens a lot when even people try formal methods by their hands, so I guess the researchers concluded that they&#x27;ll have to audit every single translation regardless of using LLM or whatever tools.\n    - **thomasahle** (): You&#x27;d think that, but Timothy Gowers (the famous mathematician they worked with) wrote (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;wtgowers&#x2F;status&#x2F;1816509817382735986\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;wtgowers&#x2F;status&#x2F;1816509817382735986</a>)<p>&gt; However, LLMs are not able to autoformalize reliably, so they got them to autoformalize each problem many times. Some of the formalizations were correct, but even the incorrect ones were useful as training data, as often they were easier problems.<p>So didn&#x27;t actually solve autoformalization, which is why they still needed humans to translate the input IMO 2024 problems.<p>The reason why formalization is harder than you think is that there is no way to know if you got it right.\nYou can use Reinforcement Learning with proofs and have a clear signal from the proof checker.\nWe don&#x27;t have a way to verify formalizations the same way.\n    - **ajross** (): &gt; To speak generally, that translation part is much easier than the proof part.<p>To you or me, sure.  But I think the proof that it isn&#x27;t for this AI system is that they didn&#x27;t do it.   Asking a modern LLM to &quot;translate&quot; something is a pretty solved problem, after all.  That argues strongly that what was happening here is not a &quot;translation&quot; but something else, like a semantic distillation.<p>If you ask a AI (or person) to prove the halting problem, they can&#x27;t.  If you &quot;translate&quot; the question into a specific example that does halt, they can run it and find out.<p>I&#x27;m suspicious, basically.\n  - **dooglius** (): The linked page says<p>&gt; While the problem statements were formalized into Lean by hand, the answers within the problem statements were generated and formalized by the agent.<p>However, it&#x27;s unclear what initial format was given to the agents that allowed this step\n    - **Smaug123** (): FWIW, GPT-4o transcribed a screenshot of problem 1 perfectly into LaTeX, so I don&#x27;t think &quot;munge the problem into machine-readable form&quot; is per se a difficult part of it these days even if they did somehow take shortcuts (which it sounds like they didn&#x27;t).\n    - **pclmulqdq** (): So if Lean was used to find the answers, where exactly is the AI?  A thin wrapper around Lean?\n- **necovek** (): This is certainly impressive, but whenever IMO is brought up, a caveat should be put out: medals are awarded to 50% of the participants (high school students), with 1:2:3 ratio between gold, silver and bronze.  That puts all gold and silver medalists among the top 25% of the participants.<p>That means that &quot;AI solves IMO problems better than 75% of the students&quot;, which is probably even more impressive.<p>But, &quot;minutes for one problem and up to 3 days for each remaining problem&quot; means that this is unfortunately not a true representation either.  If these students were given up to 15 days (5 problems at &quot;up to 3 days each&quot;) instead of 9h, there would probably be more of them that match or beat this score too.<p>It really sounds like AI solved only a single problem in the 9h students get, so it certainly would not be even close to the medals.  What&#x27;s the need to taint the impressive result with apples-to-oranges comparison?<p>Why not be more objective and report that it took longer but was able to solve X% of problems (or scored X out of N points)?\n  - **SonOfLilit** (): I have met IMO competitors. They are insanely smart. I wouldn&#x27;t imagine it&#x27;s possible to be that smart before I started hanging in these circles. So more like 25% of 0.01% of high school students.<p>Time is not a very interesting dimension here, because humans don&#x27;t use the same CPU as huge GPU clusters. The binary &quot;is it able to reach a solution given enough resources?&quot; is more interesting (for GPT&#x2F;Claude the answer is a clear negative).\n    - **necovek** (): You probably misinterpreted the above: 25% of the participants in IMO, who are generally high school students. Never claimed that 25% of all high schoolers would do better.<p>Now, you may say how time is not a useful dimension here, but really, this is where we are seeing a lot of these advances come from: general researchers today do get access to huge compute capability, allowing them to quickly iterate on different ideas. In a sense, they can be less smart about their use of resources and simply try things out: this does drive the innovation (compared to waiting for their turn on a supercomputer nearby).<p>And finally, time is essential even for humans: given a couple hundred years, they will find the proof for Fermat&#x27;s last theorem, but they might not do it in 4.5h. Since we are comparing AI capabilities to humans in the article, it&#x27;s very possible that increased compute will <i>never</i> allow AI to find novel proofs we have not come up with either. That&#x27;s where the AI bit comes in: we know that brute searching through the entire possible space of proofs is still too expensive for our compute capabilities, so we need AI to emulate our &quot;intuition&quot; when looking for the direction to narrow down the search.<p>So there are really two reasons time matters: 1. getting enough of compute might still be far away (heck, prime factorization and elliptic curves are still the basis of the most of world cryptography for that reason) and 2. maybe it&#x27;s not even enough to increase compute capability to make huge jumps in problem solving capabilities (iow, maybe we are reaching maximum of where the approach can take us).\n    - **lupire** (): But many more of those students (including many not in the contest) could solve those problems given more time than the 4.5hr sessions.<p>If these problems were important to solve, redundantly by thousands or millions of people (like the real work that most people do), far more people would put in the effort to learn how to solve these problems.<p>It&#x27;s just a weird comparison. Contests are very artificially structured in ways that don&#x27;t make sense for comparing to computers.\n    - **astromaniak** (): I&#x27;ve seen chess players, they are smart too. So what? Specialized model on commodity hardware beats most of them, if not all. This doesn&#x27;t mean model is smarter. The same could be here. Is it possible that solutions are one step from model&#x27;s database, or training set. Humans don&#x27;t remember this much and have to do many more actions in their heads.<p>In other words model which can solve any&#x2F;most school &#x2F; college exam problem isn&#x27;t necessarily smart. It can be just a database, or, in fact, a lookup table. Smarter version can be a lookup + 1 step test. Not saying it&#x27;s bad, but it doesn&#x27;t scale to less formalized domains. BTW, in this case formalization was done by humans.\n  - **NiloCK** (): &gt; medals are awarded to 50% of the participants (high school students)<p>In case this confuses anyone: the high school students in question are not a standard sample of high school students. AFAIK, they are teams of the ~6 strongest competitive problem solving high school students from each country.\n  - **Davidzheng** (): In my opinion (not Google s) the only reason they didn&#x27;t get gold this year (apart from being unlucky on problem selection) is that they didn&#x27;t want to try for any partial credit in P3 and P5. They are so close to the cut off and usually contestants with a little bit of progress can get 1 point. But i guess they didn&#x27;t want to get a gold on a technicality--it would be bad press. So they settled in a indisputable silver\n    - **lozenge** (): The AI took a day on one of the problems so it must have generated and discarded a lot of proofs that didn&#x27;t work. How could it choose which one to submit as the answer, except the objective fact of the proof passing in Lean.\n    - **llwu** (): Partial credit is quite challenging to earn, per: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imo-official.org&#x2F;year_statistics.aspx?year=2024\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imo-official.org&#x2F;year_statistics.aspx?year=2024</a>\n    - **dooglius** (): I don&#x27;t believe anything was graded by the IMO, Google is just giving itself 7 for anything proved in Lean (which is reasonable IMO), so they can&#x27;t really try for partial credit so much as choose not to report a higher self-graded number.\n- **golol** (): This is the real deal. AlphaGeometry solved a very limited set of problems with a lot of brute force search. This is a much broader method that I believe will have a great impact on the way we do mathematics. They are really implementing a self-feeding pipeling from natural language mathematics to formalized mathematics where they can train both formalization and proving. In principle this pipeline can also learn basic theory building like creating auxilliary definitions and Lemmas. I really think this is the holy grail of proof-assistance and will allow us to formalize most mathematics that we create very naturally. Humans will work podt-rigorously and let the machine asisst with filling in the details.\n  - **fmap** (): Agreed, this is a big step forward. Geometry problems are in a different class, since you can translate them into systems of polynomial equations and use well known computer algebra algorithms to solve them.<p>By contrast, this kind of open ended formalization is something where progress used to be extremely slow and incremental. I worked in an adjacent field 5 years ago and I cannot stress enough that these results are simply out of reach for traditional automated reasoning techniques.<p>Real automatic theorem proving is also useful for a lot more than pure mathematics. For example, it&#x27;s simple to write out an axiomatic semantics for a small programming language in lean and pose a question of the form &quot;show that there exists a program which satisfies this specification&quot;.<p>If this approach scales it&#x27;ll be far more important than any other ML application that has come out in the last few years.\n    - **cubefox** (): &gt; Agreed, this is a big step forward. Geometry problems are in a different class, since you can translate them into systems of polynomial equations and use well known computer algebra algorithms to solve them.<p>The blog post indicates the opposite. The geometry problem in the IMO problem set was solved by AlphaGeometry 2, which is an LLM based on Google&#x27;s Gemini. LLMs are considered relatively general systems. But the other three solved problems were proved by AlphaProof, which is a narrow RL system that is literally based on AlphaZero, the Go and Chess AI. Only its initial (bootstrapping) human training data (proofs) were formalized and augmented by an LLM (Gemini).\n  - **visarga** (): &gt; a lot of brute force search<p>Don&#x27;t dismiss search, it might be brute force but it goes beyond human level in Go and silver at IMO. Search is also what powers evolution which created us, also by a lot of brute forcing, and is at the core of scientific method (re)search.\n    - **gowld** (): What makes solving IMO problems hard is usually the limits of human memory, pattern-matching, and search, not creativity. After all, these are problems that are <i>already</i> solved, and it is expected that many people can solve the problems in about 1 hour&#x27;s time.<p>That makes it, in principle, similar or even easier than a champsionship-level chess move, which often take more than 1 hour for a professional human (with more training than an IMO high school student) to solve.<p>Another interesting concern is that when posing a problem to humans, it&#x27;s fine to pose an &quot;easy&quot; brute-forceable problem, but humans, being slow brute-searchers, need to find  more clever solutions. But if you give such a problem to a computer, it can trivialize it. So to test a computer, you need to pose non- easily-brute-forceable problems, which are harder for the computer than the others, but equally difficult for the humans as the other problems are.\n    - **thomasahle** (): Also AlphaProof had to search for 60 hours for one of the IMO problems it solved.\n    - **Eridrus** (): Search is great, search works, but there was not a tonne to learn from the AlphaGeometry paper unless you were specifically interested in solving geometry problems.\n  - **sideeffffect** (): People are already working on this<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leandojo.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leandojo.org&#x2F;</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;machine-learning-for-theorem-proving.github.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;machine-learning-for-theorem-proving.github.io&#x2F;</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=P5ew0BrRm_I\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=P5ew0BrRm_I</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paperswithcode.com&#x2F;task&#x2F;automated-theorem-proving\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paperswithcode.com&#x2F;task&#x2F;automated-theorem-proving</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;math&#x2F;comments&#x2F;11mb9lx&#x2F;future_of_automated_theorem_proving&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;math&#x2F;comments&#x2F;11mb9lx&#x2F;future_of_aut...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;RiccardoBiosas&#x2F;LeanGPT\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;RiccardoBiosas&#x2F;LeanGPT</a>\n"}]}

We must acknowledge users want to run `node foo.ts` without installing external dependencies or loaders.\n\n> There is a TC39 proposal for [type annotations](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-type-annotations)\n\n### Why type stripping\n\nType stripping as the name suggest, means removing all the `types`, transform the input in a JavaScript module.\n\n```ts\nconst foo: string = \"foo\";\n```\n\nBecomes:\n\n```js\nconst foo = \"foo\";\n```\n\nOther runtimes also perform transformation of some TypeScript only features into JavaScript, for example enums, which do not exists in JavaScript.  \nAt least initially in this PR no trasformation is performed, meaning that using `Enum`, `namespaces` etc... will not be possible.\n\n### Why I chose @swc/wasm-typescript\n\nBecause of _simplicity_.  \nI have considered other tools but they require either rust or go to be added to the toolchain.  \n`@swc/wasm-typescript` its a small package with a wasm and a js file to bind it.  \nSwc is currently used by Deno for the same purpose, it's battle tested.  \nIn the future I see this being implemented in **native layer**.  \nMassive shoutout to [@kdy1](https://github.com/kdy1)\n for releasing a swc version for us.\n\n* * *\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Refer to the PR changes in `typescript.md` for implementation details and limitations.\n\nSorry, something went wrong.\n\n \n\n\ud83d\udc4d 649 benjamingr, fabiospampinato, ArturJS, niieani, karlhorky, RobertoSimonini1, juancarlosjr97, raulmarindev, hardfist, AugustinMauroy, and 639 more reacted with thumbs up emoji \ud83d\udc4e 19 kkocdko, latin-1, vrtnis, azizsigar, madhums, kungfooman, egasimus, Oleg2tor, donatj, Flrande, and 9 more reacted with thumbs down emoji \ud83c\udf89 154 darrylyeo, castrogarciajs, gangsthub, ArthurKun21, collin, Klaster1, jedieaston, Fannon, mdrobny, vrtnis, and 144 more reacted with hooray emoji \u2764\ufe0f 256 karlhorky, anuraghazra, trivikr, SuperchupuDev, kibertoad, atlowChemi, felixfbecker, gabro, vecerek, tomwatkins1994, and 246 more reacted with heart emoji \ud83d\ude80 188 daeyeon, legendecas, ronag, karlhorky, anuraghazra, SuperchupuDev, RomainLanz, shrujalshah28, balazsorban44, kibertoad, and 178 more reacted with rocket emoji \ud83d\udc40 47 karlhorky, anuraghazra, SuperchupuDev, wojtekmaj, juancarlosjr97, eseiker, o-az, SukkaW, jaydenseric, kirillgroshkov, and 37 more reacted with eyes emoji\n\nAll reactions\n\n*   \ud83d\udc4d 649 reactions\n*   \ud83d\udc4e 19 reactions\n*   \ud83c\udf89 154 reactions\n*   \u2764\ufe0f 256 reactions\n*   \ud83d\ude80 188 reactions\n*   \ud83d\udc40 47 reactions\n\n[![@nodejs-github-bot](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18269663?s=80&u=0c9e9c1f0a4d40e2b3f46d18f0e6721f9125411a&v=4)](/nodejs-github-bot)\n\nCopy link\n\nCollaborator\n\n### \n\n**[nodejs-github-bot](/nodejs-github-bot)** commented [Jul 4, 2024](#issuecomment-2209205316)\n\nReview requested:\n\n*   [ ]  @nodejs/actions\n*   [ ]  @nodejs/gyp\n*   [ ]  @nodejs/loaders\n*   [ ]  @nodejs/security-wg\n*   [ ]  @nodejs/tsc\n\n  \n\nAll reactions\n\nSorry, something went wrong.\n\n[![@nodejs-github-bot](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18269663?s=40&u=0c9e9c1f0a4d40e2b3f46d18f0e6721f9125411a&v=4)](/nodejs-github-bot)\n [nodejs-github-bot](/nodejs-github-bot)\n added [lib / src](/nodejs/node/labels/lib%20%2F%20src)\n Issues and PRs related to general changes in the lib or src directory.

can\u2019t have extension searching just for TypeScript files; and for many reasons we don\u2019t support it in ESM. However it\u2019s not necessary: users should write their `import` specifiers with `.ts` extensions, like `import './file.ts'`, and there\u2019s [https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#allowImportingTsExtensions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#allowImportingTsExtensions)\n `allowImportingTsExtensions` to support this via `tsconfig.json`. Such behavior also aligns us with Deno.\n\nIf the user wants to use the same source files both run directly via this new flag _and_ run as transpiled JavaScript output by a build tool, it would be the responsibility of the build tool to convert `file.ts` into `file.js`; but this is something that build tools are more than capable of handling.\n\n  \n\n\ud83d\udc4d 1 gabssnake reacted with thumbs up emoji\n\nAll reactions\n\n*   \ud83d\udc4d 1 reaction\n\nSorry, something went wrong.\n\n[![@marco-ippolito](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36735501?s=40&u=8e93f809522831771aab98cbb2a67c5e67e673d5&v=4)](/marco-ippolito)\n [marco-ippolito](/marco-ippolito)\n [force-pushed](/nodejs/node/compare/e7d70d71c32524a3d4824f35c2a7825a00603f30..7a22f7f048adfe5516f1fdd70c20339fe3b7ec68)\n the feat/typescript-support branch from [`e7d70d7`](/nodejs/node/commit/e7d70d71c32524a3d4824f35c2a7825a00603f30)\n to [`7a22f7f`](/nodejs/node/commit/7a22f7f048adfe5516f1fdd70c20339fe3b7ec68)\n [Compare](/nodejs/node/compare/e7d70d71c32524a3d4824f35c2a7825a00603f30..7a22f7f048adfe5516f1fdd70c20339fe3b7ec68)\n [July 4, 2024 16:20](#event-13396945130)\n\n[![@joyeecheung](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4299420?s=80&u=d7eb2cf3db5f2a4df73a8f719c2e9e3d648e4e43&v=4)](/joyeecheung)\n\nCopy link\n\nMember\n\n### \n\n**[joyeecheung](/joyeecheung)** commented [Jul 4, 2024](#issuecomment-2209314564)\n\nThere are two aspects of TypeScript support here:\n\n1.

If we want to keep it flagged as `--strip-syntax` eventually, then doing 2 is fine, though we might want to warn that it would be in conflict with other TypeScript loaders that actually do more like supporting enums.\n\n`import foo from \"./foo\"` is not supported, file extension is needed.  \nWith this pr there is no resolution override, the test \ud83d\udc47  \n[https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/53725/files#diff-2fcd423c995b0d2501236a6f427092c5ab1df06ba9241285a471eebc2f12970dR40](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/53725/files#diff-2fcd423c995b0d2501236a6f427092c5ab1df06ba9241285a471eebc2f12970dR40)\n  \nI added an item in the issue to track the work to discuss about this\n\n  \n\nAll reactions\n\nSorry, something went wrong.\n\n[![@RedYetiDev](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38299977?s=40&u=88aefc5a0e292a8e7147d1941c70fcc8a4153da6&v=4)](/RedYetiDev)\n [RedYetiDev](/RedYetiDev)\n added the [experimental](/nodejs/node/labels/experimental)\n Issues and PRs related to experimental features. label [Jul 4, 2024](#event-13397093712)\n\n[![RedYetiDev](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38299977?s=60&v=4)](/RedYetiDev)\n\n**[RedYetiDev](/RedYetiDev)** reviewed [Jul 4, 2024](#pullrequestreview-2159256657)\n\n[View reviewed changes](/nodejs/node/pull/53725/files)\n\n[doc/api/cli.md](/nodejs/node/pull/53725/files#diff-7349c17bce4d97526eefcb6f8291d617e7edb92ed9927fd3b9264e8014fc4e7c)\n Outdated Show resolved Hide resolved\n\n[![@marco-ippolito](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36735501?s=40&u=8e93f809522831771aab98cbb2a67c5e67e673d5&v=4)](/marco-ippolito)\n [marco-ippolito](/marco-ippolito)\n [force-pushed](/nodejs/node/compare/7a22f7f048adfe5516f1fdd70c20339fe3b7ec68..f6fd494cd1ef67f92e13d728293ca4fa592944ab)\n the feat/typescript-support branch from [`7a22f7f`](/nodejs/node/commit/7a22f7f048adfe5516f1fdd70c20339fe3b7ec68)\n to [`f6fd494`](/nodejs/node/commit/f6fd494cd1ef67f92e13d728293ca4fa592944ab)\n [Compare](/nodejs/node/compare/7a22f7f048adfe5516f1fdd70c20339fe3b7ec68..f6fd494cd1ef67f92e13d728293ca4fa592944ab)\n [July 4, 2024 16:54](#event-13397180232)\n\n[![@AugustinMauroy](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97875033?s=80&u=b404c5f494361efd7568bc55ad03928dc096e20b&v=4)](/AugustinMauroy)\n\nCopy link\n\nContributor\n\n### \n\n**[AugustinMauroy](/AugustinMauroy)** commented [Jul 4, 2024](#issuecomment-2209375989)\n \u2022\n\nedited\n\nLoading\n\nIn test suite I think we should add some test to know how node will work with that:\n\n```ts\nconst X = {} as const;\n```\n\nand\n\n```ts\nimport type { Config } from 'myConfig.d.ts';\n\nexport const config = {} satisfies Config;\n```\n\n  \n\nAll reactions\n\nSorry, something went wrong.\n\n[![benjamingr](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1315533?s=60&v=4)](/benjamingr)\n\n**[benjamingr](/benjamingr)** reviewed [Jul 4, 2024](#pullrequestreview-2159510879)\n\n[View reviewed changes](/nodejs/node/pull/53725/files)\n\n[doc/api/module.md](/nodejs/node/pull/53725/files#diff-4e8f3cce79719e4a337f58575b20c998b093eb64164b847ca0eb9ba884d8a801)\n Outdated Show resolved Hide resolved\n\n[![wojtekmaj](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5426427?s=60&v=4)](/wojtekmaj)\n\n**[wojtekmaj](/wojtekmaj)** reviewed [Jul 4, 2024](#pullrequestreview-2159510932)\n\n[View reviewed changes](/nodejs/node/pull/53725/files)\n\n[doc/api/module.md](/nodejs/node/pull/53725/files#diff-4e8f3cce79719e4a337f58575b20c998b093eb64164b847ca0eb9ba884d8a801)\n Outdated Show resolved Hide resolved\n\n[![benjamingr](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1315533?s=60&v=4)](/benjamingr)\n\n**[benjamingr](/benjamingr)** reviewed [Jul 4, 2024](#pullrequestreview-2159511358)\n\n[View reviewed changes](/nodejs/node/pull/53725/files)\n\nCopy link\n\nMember\n\n### \n\n![@benjamingr](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1315533?s=48&v=4) **[benjamingr](/benjamingr)** left a comment\n\n[](#pullrequestreview-2159511358)\n\nThere was a problem hiding this comment.\n\n### Choose a reason for hiding this comment\n\nThe reason will be displayed to describe this comment to others.

Usage of `.ts` extensions in imports and the `allowImportingTsExtensions` flag in TypeScript land is virtually non existent.

To complicate things even further ESMs resolution in TypeScript is mostly achieved in codebases by adding `.js` extension to imports _even if the .js file at that path does not exist_.\n    \n\n[https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules/theory.html#module-resolution-for-libraries](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules/theory.html#module-resolution-for-libraries)\n\nThis is especially important in library code (as many projects out of there simply opt-out of ESM entirely and either create bundles FE-wise, or they compile down to CJS for Node ones) but the number of real world products using this pattern increases consistently every day with CJS being phased out by an ever growing number of projects.\n\nI wonder whether the flag could strip types and run `@swc/wasm-typescript` on files regardless of their extension. If it is a normal js file it will simply not need to strip anything (albeit it will still have to parse it).\n\n  \n\n\ud83d\udc4d 15 karlhorky, fregante, octet-stream, janmeier, aantia, egasimus, martin-juul, juxuanu, electrovir, haltcase, and 5 more reacted with thumbs up emoji \ud83d\udc4e 1 gabssnake reacted with thumbs down emoji\n\nAll reactions\n\n*   \ud83d\udc4d 15 reactions\n*   \ud83d\udc4e 1 reaction\n\nSorry, something went wrong.\n\n[![@marco-ippolito](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36735501?s=40&u=8e93f809522831771aab98cbb2a67c5e67e673d5&v=4)](/marco-ippolito)\n [marco-ippolito](/marco-ippolito)\n [force-pushed](/nodejs/node/compare/f6fd494cd1ef67f92e13d728293ca4fa592944ab..206457c1a6d5dad26cadd83ff3ec99579eff8c47)\n the feat/typescript-support branch from [`f6fd494`](/nodejs/node/commit/f6fd494cd1ef67f92e13d728293ca4fa592944ab)\n to [`206457c`](/nodejs/node/commit/206457c1a6d5dad26cadd83ff3ec99579eff8c47)\n [Compare](/nodejs/node/compare/f6fd494cd1ef67f92e13d728293ca4fa592944ab..206457c1a6d5dad26cadd83ff3ec99579eff8c47)\n [July 5, 2024 05:57](#event-13401506803)\n\n[![@marco-ippolito](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36735501?s=80&u=8e93f809522831771aab98cbb2a67c5e67e673d5&v=4)](/marco-ippolito)\n\nCopy link\n\nMember Author\n\n### \n\n**[marco-ippolito](/marco-ippolito)** commented [Jul 5, 2024](#issuecomment-2210238407)\n \u2022\n\nedited\n\nLoading\n\n> This is neat, I'd like to see extensionless imports work if possible, but I also think this can land as-is and those issues fixed before making it stable.\n\n[@benjamingr](https://github.com/benjamingr)\n this is currently not possible because of this [mandatory-file-extensions](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#mandatory-file-extensions)\n, it really depends on the esm loader.\n\n> Usage of .ts extensions in imports and the allowImportingTsExtensions flag in TypeScript land is virtually non existent.

to perform a few expensive operation on the file system and a heuristic attempt to guess the extension.\n\nExample:\n\n*   `import foo from './foo.js'`\n*   stat `./foo.js` => does not exists\n*   stat `./foo.ts` => exists  \n    And\n*   `import foo from './foo.ts'`\n*   stat `./foo.ts` => does not exists\n*   stat `./foo.js` => exists\n\nWe will iterate on this and it's tracked in the issue

Stripping types is not a token-level operation, and the TypeScript grammar is changing all the time.<p>Consider for example: `foo &lt; bar &amp; baz &gt; ( x )`. In TypeScript 1.5 this parsed as (foo&lt;bar) &amp; (baz &gt; (x)) because bar&amp;baz wasn\u2019t a valid type expression yet. When the type intersection operator was added, the parse changed to foo&lt;(bar &amp; baz)&gt;(x) which desugared to foo(x). I realise I\u2019m going back in time here but it\u2019s a nice simple example.<p>If you want to continue to use new TypeScript features you are going to need to keep compiling to JS, or else keep your node version up to date. For people who like to stick on node LTS releases this may be an unacceptable compromise.\n  - **madeofpalk** (): It looks like the team has already considered this in one regard<p>&gt; <i>There is already a precedent for something that Node.js support, that can be upgraded seperately, its NPM.\nNode bundles a version of npm that can upgraded separately, we could do the same with our TypeScript transpiler.</i><p>&gt; <i>We could create a package that we bundle but that can also be downloaded from NPM, keep a stable version in core, but if TypeScript releases new features that we don&#x27;t support or breaking changes, or users want to use the new shiny experimental feature, they can upgrade it separately.\nThis ensures that users are not locked, but also provides support for a TypeScript version for the whole 3 years of the lifetime of Node.js release.</i><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nodejs&#x2F;loaders&#x2F;issues&#x2F;217\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nodejs&#x2F;loaders&#x2F;issues&#x2F;217</a>\n    - **SomeCallMeTim** (): As long as Node understands to use the project-specific version of TypeScript (i.e., the one in node_modules or the PNP equivalent), that should be fine.<p>But it would be a step backward to need to globally upgrade TypeScript (as you do with npm), since some older projects will <i>not</i> be compatible with newer versions of TypeScript.<p>Ask me how I know. ;)\n  - **WorldMaker** (): The syntax from the perspective of type <i>stripping</i> has been relatively stable for more versions of Typescript than it was unstable. You had to reach all the way back to 1.5 in part because it&#x27;s been very stable since about 2.x. The last major shift in syntax was probably Conditional Types in 2.8 adding the ternary if operator in type positions. (The type <i>model</i> if you were to try to typecheck rather than just type-strip has changed a lot since 2.x, but syntax has been generally stable. That&#x27;s where most of Typescript&#x27;s innovation has been in the type model&#x2F;type inferencing rather than in syntax.)<p>It&#x27;s still just (early in the process) Stage 1, but the majority of Typescript&#x27;s type syntax, for the purposes of type stripping (not type checking), <i>is</i> attempting to be somewhat standardized: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tc39&#x2F;proposal-type-annotations\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tc39&#x2F;proposal-type-annotations</a>\n    - **teaearlgraycold** (): They did <i>just</i> add a new keyword, satisfies, in 5.4. That would be a breaking change if you can\u2019t upgrade the type stripper separately.\n  - **the_gipsy** (): You would also have to update your compiler. I guess you could phrase this as: you can&#x27;t update your TS versions independently from your node.js version. But that&#x27;s probably not an issue.\n    - **zarzavat** (): It\u2019s an issue because node has a system of LTS releases, whereas TypeScript has quarterly updates, so the release cadence is different.<p>Updating node is much more fraught than updating TypeScript. For example, it may break any native code modules. That\u2019s why users are directed to use the LTS and not the most recent release, so that there\u2019s enough time for libraries to add support for the new version.<p>On the other hand, I usually adopt a new TypeScript version as soon as it comes out.\n    - **klodolph** (): Not necessarily.<p>With a couple exceptions (like enums), you can strip the types out of TypeScript and end up with valid JS. What you <i>could</i> do is stabilize the grammar, and release new versions of TypeScript using the same grammar. Maybe you need a flag to use LTS grammar in your tsconfig.json file.\n- **pansa2** (): If Node.js can run TypeScript files directly, then the TypeScript compiler won&#x27;t need to strip types and convert to JavaScript - it could be used solely as a type checker. This would be similar to the situation in Python, where type checkers check types and leave them intact, and the Python interpreter just ignores them.<p>It&#x27;s interesting, though, that this approach in Python has led to several (4?) different popular type checkers, which AFAIK all use the same type hint syntax but apply different semantics. However for JavaScript, TypeScript seems to have become the one-and-only popular type checker.<p>In Python, I&#x27;ve even heard of people writing types in source code but never checking them, essentially using type hints as a more convenient syntax for comments. Support for ignoring types in Node.js would make that approach possible in JavaScript as well.\n  - **winter_blue** (): Flow (by Facebook) used to be fairly significant in the JavaScript several years ago, but right now it&#x27;s somewhat clear that TypeScript has won rather handily.\n    - **mattnewton** (): Before that there was the closure compiler (Google) which had type annotations in comments. \nThe annotation syntax in comments was a little clunky but overall that project was ahead of it&#x27;s time. \nNow I believe even inside google that has been transpiled to typescript (or typescript is being transpiled to closure, I can&#x27;t remember which - the point is that the typescript interface is what people are using for new code).\n    - **sesm** (): There was no real competition, Flow was a practical internal tool with 0 marketing budget. Typescript is typical MS 3E strategy with a huge budget. Needless to say, Flow is much more practical and less intrusive, but marketing budget captured all the newbie devs.\n    - **simplify** (): Facebook never gave Flow enough resources, whereas Microsoft has had 10+ devs on TypeScript for a long time.\n  - **Doxin** (): &gt; In Python, I&#x27;ve even heard of people writing types in source code but never checking them, essentially using type hints as a more convenient syntax for comments.<p>Note that there&#x27;s IDEs that&#x27;ll use type hints to improve autocomplete and the like too, so even when not checking types it can make sense to add them in some places.\n  - **dobladov** (): You can have this now adding types with JSDoc and validating them with typescript without compiling, you get faster builds and code that works everywhere without magic or need to strip anything else than comments.<p>The biggest pain point of using JSDoc at least for me was the import syntax, this has changed since Typescript 5.5, and it&#x27;s now not an issue anymore.\n    - **murmansk** (): [flagged]\n    - **eezing** (): Good for annotating js files here and there, but lousy dx.\n    - **itsmeste** (): I strongly agree, but JSDoc isn&#x27;t &quot;the cool thing&quot;. So it&#x27;s left to be used by us, who care (and read their docs).\n- **unilynx** (): If this feature ever becomes the default (ie not behind a flag) - how will the NPM ecosystem respond? Will contributors still bother to build CJS end EJS versions when publishing a NPM module, or just slap an &#x27;engine: nodejs &gt;= 25&#x27; on the package.json and stop bothering with the build step before pushing to NPM ?<p>I <i>personally</i> would very much prefer if NPM modules that have their original code in TS and are currently transpiling would stop shipping dist&#x2F;<i>.cjs so I unambiguously know where to put my debugger&#x2F;console.log statements. And it would probably be very tempting to NPM contributors to not have to bother with a build step anymore.<p>But won&#x27;t this start a ripple effect through NPM where everyone will start to assume very quickly &#x27;everyone accepts TS files&#x27; - it only takes one of your dependencies for this effect to ripple through? It seems to me that nodejs can&#x27;t move this outside an opt-in-experimental-flag without the whole community implicitly expecting all consumers to accept TS files before you know it. And if they do, it will be just months before Firefox and Safari will be force to accept it too, so all JS compilers will have to discard TS type annotations<p>Which I would personally be happy with - we&#x27;re building transcompiling steps into NPM modules that convert the ts code into js and d.ts just to support some hypothetical JS user even though we&#x27;re using TS on the including side. But if node accepts </i>.ts files we could just remove those transpiling steps without ever noticing it... so what&#x27;s stopping NPM publishers from publishing js&#x2F;d.ts files without noticing they broke anything?\n  - **Omerd6** (): The legendary Ryan dahl is actually working on solving the exact problem you described by creating a new package registry called JSR.<p>Essentially what it does is allow you to upload your typescript code without a build step so when other devs install it they can see the source code of the module in it&#x27;s original typescript instead of transpiled JavaScript.\n    - **sam_perez** (): That&#x27;s really cool. One of the benefits of the JS ecosystem is the ability to step through code and crack open your dependencies. Not sure if this would directly make this possible when running your projects&#x2F;tests, but it at least sounds like a step in that direction.\n    - **meowtimemania** (): it must install compiled and uncompiled versions? Otherwise node (without the above flag) would throw errors when it encounters types in node_modules\n  - **satanacchio** (): We dont support running .ts files in node_modules, this is one of the main constraints to avoid breaking the ecosystem\n  - **rnmkr** (): I would love to ship my source code (.ts) to npm. But Typescript team was very much against this, as there&#x27;ll be tsconfig issues and other performance issues. But still fingers crossed.\n"}]}

Many of them are drivers or machinists\u2014blue-collar workers for the company.\u00a0\n\nHow? The company is owned by its employees. Every worker gets a salary but also a percentage of their salary in stock ownership. When the company does well, so do the employees\u2014all of them, not just the ones at the top.\u00a0\n\nAnd the company _is_ doing well. \u201cWhen we sat down eight years ago, we said we want to be a billion-dollar company and have 1,500 people, we are on track to be both of those this year,\u201d [Tim Ruger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-ruger-b9763011/)\n, president of Central States, tells me.\n\nThat\u2019s right, this manufacturing company will become a unicorn this year\u2014one of only [6,000](https://companiesmarketcap.com/largest-companies-by-revenue/)\n companies in the world earning more than $1 billion in revenue. But unlike Walmart, Amazon, and Apple, it\u2019s not just the executives getting paid out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like 80 percent of the company is owned by management and the rest is owned by employees, it\u2019s really well spread across all functions,\u201d\u00a0 Ruger tells me. \u201cWe've got a number of people that have been here 15, 20 years and they have $1 million plus balances, which is really cool for a person that came out of high school and runs our rollformer. You can\u2019t do that everywhere.\u201d\n\nThe Elysian is independent journalism focused on a better future. Thank you for supporting my work.\n\nSubscribe\n\nHe\u2019s right, and because you can\u2019t do that everywhere there is a huge wealth disparity in America. Even though the economy has been on an upward trajectory for a century, the wealth it generates has funneled to a much smaller population who owns it. After [a 1990s bill](https://www.elysian.press/p/an-alternative-to-tax-the-rich)\n meant executives started getting paid in stock options while the rest of their employees earned a static salary, executive pay skyrocketed with the market while their workers\u2019 pay stagnated.\u00a0\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8a6160-0cc6-4938-960c-754fa06a7532_1216x1172.webp)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8a6160-0cc6-4938-960c-754fa06a7532_1216x1172.webp)\n\nIf employees had also owned part of the company, their pay would have skyrocketed with the market too, but they didn\u2019t. \u201cIt's hard to build true wealth for yourself if you don't have some type of ownership in something, and it's hard for most people to get ownership in something,\u201d Ruger says.\u00a0\n\nUpping the minimum wage won\u2019t fix that. As Nathan Schneider says in his book _[Everything for Everyone](https://bookshop.org/a/2268/9781568589596)\n_: \u201cOne way or another, wealth is going to the owners\u2014of where we live, where we work, and what we consume.\u201d\n\nSo why not make workers the owners?\n\nThere is a growing movement to do just that. Central States is one of [6,533 companies](https://www.nceo.org/articles/employee-ownership-by-the-numbers)\n that have formed an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (or ESOP) in the United States, and that number is growing by about 250 companies annually. That\u2019s 14.7 million employees who have ownership in companies worth, collectively, $2.1 trillion.\u00a0\n\nEvery year, those employees get a percentage of their salaries in company stock. During Central States\u2019 worst year, employees earned the equivalent of 6 percent of their pay in stock, during their best they earned 26 percent. Last year, an employee earning $100,000 a year received $26,000 worth of stock in their account. As the company has grown, the value of that stock has averaged 20 percent returns annually, outperforming the stock market.\u00a0\n\nJust like Jeff Bezos can sell a portion of his Amazon stock to buy a new house, employees at ESOPs can pull money out of their stock accounts to pay for tuition, medical bills, or as a downpayment on a primary residence.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe have several in production and drivers who have been here for over 20 years that have multi-million dollar accounts,\u201d [Chad Ware](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chad-ware-b9307b234/)\n, Central States\u2019 CFO tells me. \u201cWe\u2019ve had several folks take out enough money to buy a home outright.\u201d\n\nAn ESOP account functions a lot like a second 401k, but invested solely in the company. Employees can pull out whenever they\u2019d like, but outside of those approved uses they will have to pay taxes and an early withdrawal fee to remove the funds before the age of 59 \u00bd. After they leave the company or retire, the complete balance of their accounts will be paid out to them over a six-year period.\u00a0\n\nThis means the company needs to have that cash on hand to pay out, and this has to be budgeted into their annual cash flow. But it also means the employees are incentivized to participate in the wellbeing of the company.\n\nOn the stock market, executives are expected to produce quarterly results, often to the detriment of their companies\u2019 long-term success. After Boeing famously rushed the rollout of its 737 MAX aircraft to meet quarterly expectations, fatal crashes and safety concerns killed [346 people](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-says-boeing-breached-2021-deferred-prosecution-737-max-agreement-2024-05-14/)\n and cost the company [$20 billion](https://knowledge.insead.edu/strategy/boeings-tragedy-fall-american-icon#:~:text=The%20737%20MAX%20fleet%20was,was%20reduced%20and%20then%20stopped.)\n. Companies like Wells Fargo, Sears, and Bausch Health have similarly cut corners to inflate short-term results at the expense of their long-term health.\n\nBut an employee at Central States doesn\u2019t care about one good quarter, they care about a good 10 years, and a good 50. If the company\u2019s products turn out to be inferior next year their stock in the company will tank, if the company goes bankrupt in 20 years it will go down to zero. It\u2019s in their best interest to act in the long-term interest of the company, and to grow it sustainably rather than quickly.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOne of our CEOs likes to say that these companies are not looking to hit home runs, they're looking to hit singles and doubles on a regular basis,\u201d [Noelle Monta\u00f1o](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noelle-montano-a940106/)\n, executive director for Employee-owned S Corporations of America (or [ESCA](https://esca.us/)\n) tells me. \u201cWhen the C-Suite goes into work every day, they see the receptionist, the person on the factory floor, the guy who's building the building or digging the ditches, and they know that those are the shareholders they are responsible for. They take that seriously.\u201d\n\nEvery month, Central States executives share the company\u2019s P&L with employees, and every year they share the financials of the business at annual shareholders meetings, where employee-owners can participate in discussions about the future of the company. After a new plant was struggling with sales in its second year, one employee-owner raised his hand at a shareholder meeting and said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t helping our company, and it\u2019s not helping my share price, can we discuss the closure of this plant?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt was a great conversation, I love the fact that it\u2019s not somebody else's problem,\u201d Ruger says. \u201cThey're thinking like business owners, which is what you want, right?\u201d\n\nAs a result, ESOPs are generally healthier companies. \u201cThese companies do better at employee retention, they do better at retirement benefits, they default less often on loans,\u201d Monta\u00f1o says. \u201cOur companies did better during the Great Recession, they did better during Covid.\u201d\n\nThere are serious benefits to the company for operating this way. ESOPs are a viable alternative to unions\u2014there is no rift between the owners and the workers, workers _are_ the owners! They are also exempt from paying income tax\u2014though they tend to spend those dollars on their employees instead.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt helped us grow when we were smaller. Now that we're larger, what we're paying out each year to our employee-owners is probably more than we would pay in tax, quite honestly,\u201d Ruger says. \u201cBut if I have to choose who we pay our money to, I'd rather pay employee owners than give it back to the government. I think it's probably the right way.\u201d\n\nHe brings up a good point. I\u2019ve mentioned before that I do not think the answer to our wealth disparity is to \u201c[tax the rich](https://www.elysian.press/p/an-alternative-to-tax-the-rich)\n.\u201d Don\u2019t take Jeff Bezos\u2019 money and give it to the government, better distribute Amazon\u2019s earnings among its employees\u2014not just to its founder.\n\n\u201cI think our taxes are way too burdening and we don\u2019t do a good job using the money. I wouldn\u2019t mind paying more if we were using it well, I just don\u2019t know if we are,\u201d Ruger says. \u201cWhy redistribute the wealth after it\u2019s already been earned, why can\u2019t we earn it beforehand? It naturally levels out the haves and have-nots.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the \u201chaves\u201d still benefit from this equation.\n\n\u201cMost ESOP companies start because the founder wants to exit or cash out, but they don't want to sell to a private equity firm that will run their company into the ground or slash and burn employee headcount,\u201d Ware says. \u201cA lot of owners built a company and were in the trenches with the people beside them. They want to take care of them, but they also want to cash out. A good option is to set up an ESOP, and that's exactly how Central States got started.\u201d\n\nCarl Carpenter founded Central States in 1988, but sold it to his employees when he retired in 1991. More specifically: He sold a portion of the shares of his company to an ESOP trust, which holds the company's shares on behalf of the employees. In 2011, the company bought the remaining shares and became 100% employee-owned. Carpenter sailed into the sunset with a nice retirement package even as he allowed his employees to start building their own, and I don\u2019t see why every founder shouldn\u2019t do the same.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere are real benefits for an owner turning the company into an ESOP,\u201d Ruger says. \u201cThey personally benefit from the sale when they exit the business. Additionally, there are some real tax benefits to turn it into an ESOP\u2014they pay a whole lot less taxes when they sell the company.\u201d\n\nThe only reason they don\u2019t do it more often is because they don\u2019t know about it. \u201cThe number one issue is education,\u201d Monta\u00f1o says. \u201cIf you're looking to sell your business and you go to your accountant or lawyer, they may not say \u2018Have you thought about an ESOP?\u2019\u201d\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s also not a quick process\u2014founders interested in selling to their employees need to plan ahead. A feasibility study needs to be conducted to ensure the viability of an ESOP plan and an independent valuation of the company needs to be conducted to determine the fair market value of the shares. A trust needs to be defined and structured, and a trustee appointed to oversee it on behalf of the employees. \u201cIf an owner just wants to get out, an ESOP is not for them,\u201d Monta\u00f1o says.\u00a0\n\nThat might be changing, ESOPs have bi-partisan support in Congress and moves have been made to improve education about ESOPS and make the transition easier for founders. \u201cWe have support from Members of Congress across the political spectrum.... It's capitalism at its best,\u201d\u00a0 Monta\u00f1o says. \u201cA year and a half ago, there was legislation mandating the Department of Labor to open an [Office of Employee Ownership](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20230710)\n, and they've taken a more robust interest in ESOP companies and recently appointed someone from the employee ownership community to this important role.\u201d\n\n[In 2022](https://www.nceo.org/articles/employee-ownership-by-the-numbers#6)\n, only 34 percent of families in the bottom half of income distribution held stocks, while 78 percent of families in the upper-middle-income group did\u201495 percent of families in the top one percent held stocks. But employee ownership changes that equation. As the process becomes easier and education about ESOPs grows, more and more founders will exit by selling their companies to their employees, and the result is that more and more of the wealth will be owned by everyone who works, not just the person they work for.\n\nAs the stock market gets richer, so will we all, and that\u2019s a future I\u2019m excited about working toward.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI'd love to see it more and more and more,\u201d Ruger says. \u201cIt's really generating wealth for people, I\u2019m convinced we're going to change generations.\u201d\n\n[Leave a comment](https://www.elysian.press/p/employee-ownership/comments)\n\nThis is a continuation of my [capitalism series](https://www.elysian.press/t/capitalism)\n which is figuring out how capitalism can work better for everyone while serving as research for my utopian novel.

The reason not every company does it to all its employees is probably that for those employees, it wouldn&#x27;t affect incentives much and it would make payment subject to the vagaries of the stock market. Your barista at Starbucks is not going to increase the stock price no matter how well he fills your order; at the same time, maybe he wants to know how much he takes home every day.<p>If the story is &quot;it should be the law that every company offers stock options&quot;, then that would be a dumb law for the reasons above.<p>If the story is &quot;all companies must be fully employee-owned workers&#x27; cooperatives&quot;, then first, note that you are calling for a restriction on workers&#x27; rights: they have to be given part of their pay as stocks, and they can&#x27;t sell them freely. Second, that will probably make markets work worse. There&#x27;s a large economics literature on this: worker-owned cooperatives have not taken over the market, although they are an available institutional form, because (a) they find it hard to raise capital (b) they tend to make decisions that maximize worker welfare rather than profit, e.g. they won&#x27;t sack underperforming divisions or expand in ways that dilute existing workers&#x27; stake.\n  - **stavros** (): Then maybe &quot;taking over the market&quot; is a bad metric, and we should be optimizing for making a company that makes the workers&#x27; lives better. The US cultural bias is showing here, as it&#x27;s assumed that profit is above all else, and a company that forgoes profit to make workers happier must thus be less good.<p>The vast majority of people in companies are workers. Let&#x27;s stop optimizing for owner wealth and start optimizing for worker happiness instead.\n    - **sotix** (): &gt; The US cultural bias is showing here, as it&#x27;s assumed that profit is above all else<p>I asked my Greek teacher what they biggest change she experienced moving to the US was, and she said that in Greece, her community prioritized happiness above all else, but everyone she met in the US prioritized making money.<p>I also asked her what the financial crisis was like in Greece, and she said that you couldn\u2019t find an empty seat at a taverna in her village on the weekends. They barely had any money, and few around her were employed, but they had certain priorities.<p>Meanwhile in the US, I had a teacher condescendingly tell me that the Greeks were lazy (ignorant of the history that led to 2008). It can be hard to see through certain cultural biases. Particularly when the primary goals are so different.\n    - **zby** (): To take over the market companies need to attract customers - i.e. make their lives better. Usually there are more consumers than employees - so I think that measure works quite well with optimising for humans. Profit is a side effect of taking over the market.<p>But actually to have any employees companies need to optimize for workers lives anyway. And it seems that cooperatives are not any better in this area - otherwise everybody would work for cooperatives.\n    - **Gormo** (): You are making normative arguments, but the question is wholly empirical -- the metrics being applied here are the ones that actually measure the success and viability of firms, not metrics selected to fit the observer&#x27;s emotional attachments.<p>Firms that are optimized for turning market demand into revenue streams will naturally outcompete firms that are optimized for other goals, regardless of what ideals or preferences anyone bears.  This isn&#x27;t something that anyone can decide upon, so a call to action based on one&#x27;s own &quot;ought&quot; preferences isn&#x27;t really meaningful.\n  - **mdorazio** (): Fun fact: Starbucks baristas <i>do</i> get RSUs [1]. It was a core principle of the company under Howard Schultz and one of the big things he credits for Starbucks&#x27;s success specifically because owning even a small part of the company increases employee sense of responsibility and pride. I highly recommend the recent in-depth interview that Acquired did with him [2].<p>Herb Kelleher famously setup Southwest Airlines with very similar principles and stock options for everyone, with pretty amazing results for decades.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.starbucksbenefits.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;home&#x2F;stock-savings&#x2F;bean-stock&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.starbucksbenefits.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;home&#x2F;stock-savings&#x2F;b...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=A0fvX-wV70Y\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=A0fvX-wV70Y</a>\n  - **dgb23** (): I&#x27;ve read studies about workers coops and some of them somewhat contradict what you say in your last paragraph, specifically (b). Worker coops often cut down on their individual profits in hard times to keep the boat afloat.<p>I think ultimately a company creates and maintains a culture, regardless of the legal structure. Maintaining a good culture requires effort and especially a sensible, trusting image of humanity.<p>When we talk about the crass gap in compensation and power between workers and owners or executives, then we often hear the excuse that much of the compensation at the top is from stocks (even though that is a very incomplete picture). The big bosses can&#x27;t just sell their stock to increase wages is the narrative, but they _could_ pay some of that stock as additional compensation.<p>A single worker doesn&#x27;t move the statistical needle in a very large corporation? For one, the same fallacy comes up with voting. Secondly: This notion that people are rational robots who only optimize their profits and then also calculate the statistical impact of every of their actions is not just too theoretical, it&#x27;s just wrong. Loyalty, trust and engagement are things you earn and maintain. A generous compensation (including stocks) can be a part of that.<p>An additional approach is to decentralize and enable partial ownership of franchises. Now suddenly the needle can be moved, day by day and year by year.<p>But again, the legal structure is just part of it all. I think it starts with the image of humanity, the culture and a long term strategy that incorporates all participants of a company. The details fall into place after that.\n    - **dash2** (): &gt; Worker coops often cut down on their individual profits in hard times to keep the boat afloat.<p>Sure, I believe that. Do they do it enough though? Co-operatives were big in 19th century Britain; now they make up a small part of the market for most things. In particular the Co-op supermarket, though it&#x27;s cute, is now small (6% market share).<p>&gt; A single worker doesn&#x27;t move the statistical needle in a very large corporation? For one, the same fallacy comes up with voting. Secondly: This notion that people are rational robots who only optimize their profits and then also calculate the statistical impact of every of their actions is not just too theoretical, it&#x27;s just wrong. Loyalty, trust and engagement are things you earn and maintain. A generous compensation (including stocks) can be a part of that.<p>It&#x27;s really true that your vote won&#x27;t decide the next election! I&#x27;m sorry :-)<p>You&#x27;re right that generous compensation can maintain loyalty and I agree people aren&#x27;t robots. But for that to save the argument you need more - stocks have to be better at maintaining loyalty than just straightforward pay. Is that true? Maybe: stocks are a &quot;stake&quot; in the company. Is it so true that many companies could improve efficiency by paying in stocks not cash? I&#x27;ll believe it when I see evidence. Is it so true that we should force companies to do it? I find it highly unlikely and the evidence is clearly inadequate.<p>&gt;An additional approach is to decentralize and enable partial ownership of franchises. Now suddenly the needle can be moved, day by day and year by year.<p>Sounds like McDonalds is your ideal of corporate structure :-) Maybe! It&#x27;s certainly successful.\n- **Nifty3929** (): I think it&#x27;s easy to look at this with an existing, successful business in mind - but things don&#x27;t always work out that way.<p>How would a business like this get started? Usually the owner is the one who invests a lot of their own time and&#x2F;or money into the business to get it off the ground in the first place. Would we be asking workers to pony up in those early years when failure is likely? With Central States, the story picks up AFTER all that, when the business is already large and successful, and the owner just wants to retire.<p>And what happens when the business struggles or fails later? In the case of Central States, the workers were asked to buy shares from the owner, probably using a portion of the salary they&#x27;d otherwise get. IOW, they&#x27;re being underpaid relative to market, in exchange for ownership, expecting to get more later when they sell the shares. So far so good, but how does this look when the business has a rough patch, even one that&#x27;s not their fault?\n  - **nostrademons** (): The article is arguing for ESOPs, basically stock options for employees.  The examples cited are actually quite tame by tech industry standards: &quot;During Central States\u2019 worst year, employees earned the equivalent of 6 percent of their pay in stock, during their best they earned 26 percent.&quot;  By contrast, FANG employees routinely make &gt;50% of their compensation in stock, and it can be up to 80% in good years.<p>As for how these get started, it&#x27;s the same as any tech startup.  The founding team owns the whole company at formation, and then they progressively give it away to increase the overall valuation of the company.  You can do that through giving away stock in exchange for funding from a VC that you can use to pay employees, or you can give away stock directly in exchange for services rendered.<p>And yes, this looks bad during a down year.  Tech companies have this problem all the time - employees are demotivated when the stock price goes down, which can have further negative effects on the stock price.\n    - **kreims** (): ESOPs are common in the civil engineer world. I have mixed feelings about it. Private company stock valuations look like a magic show to my untrained eyes. Employee-only buying can lead to weird cash-flow schemes, like your ESOP contribution being held, unbeknownst to you, in a zero-interest slush fund until stock frees up.<p>What gets me most is that rank and file employees in the ESOP almost never have directly exercisable rights as shareholders to vote or have any say in the business. You don\u2019t get to say no to a merger. You don\u2019t get to fire the CEO when his big idea is a flop. The ESOP vote is wrapped up in a trust or some abstraction controlled by an advisor or a board probably appointed by the real board of the company. Ultimately the executive staff and hand-picked insiders will have all the real authority of ownership. Employee stock thus is not much more than a complex pension program for almost everyone.  Regular employees will not be real owners in any meaningful sense unless they get into the small trust network of existing owners.<p>If you\u2019re an early arrival to an ESOP with good growth potential, you will do way better than someone with a little 401K match. They also get great tax breaks. Overall they\u2019re good for employees, but the messaging is usually misleading.\n    - **victorbjorklund** (): Getting some of your salary in stock options isn&#x27;t really an employee owned company. How many % of total Google shares are owned by employees (excluding the founding employees)? 0,0000000001%? At least 50% would be required for it to be viewed as an employee owned company.\n    - **jasode** (): <i>&gt;As for how these get started, it&#x27;s the same as any tech startup. [...] </i><p>To clarify, the gp was asking a rhetorical question that he already knew the answer to  when he stated, <i>&quot;How would a business [that already looks attractive for ESOP] like this get started? [... his recap similar to your recap ...]&quot;</i><p>To put it differently, the scenario he&#x27;s trying to explain is something like this given that ~9 out 10 businesses fail :<p>- you can&#x27;t look at just a single company&#x27;s successful timeline to judge the ESOP for society; <i>you also have to consider all the failed companies and how ESOPs would play out in those timelines as well</i>.  Since ~90% of businesses fail, you have to play out the financial dynamics of employees buying into ownership of all those failed companies.  And in contradiction of employee-ownership, a lot of employees would prefer getting a bigger paycheck from a dying company rather than having money deducted to buy worthless equity shares.<p>- e.g. of course employees would love to be significant workers-cooperative owners of Amazon Inc and Apple Inc.  <i>But the analysis also must include employees owning worthless shares of Pets.com (bankrupt 2000 and shutdown) and Commodore Computer (bankrupt 1994).</i>  Some workers got employee-ownership shares of Commodore Inc instead of Apple Inc?!?  Well, it sucks to be those workers.\n  - **RandomCitizen12** (): &gt; How would a business like this get started? Usually the owner is the one who invests a lot of their own time and&#x2F;or money into the business to get it off the ground in the first place. Would we be asking workers to pony up in those early years when failure is likely?<p>In Canada, there are &#x27;Labour Sponsored Venture Capital Corporations&#x27; with union overseers to do this and special tax deductions for investing money through these.<p>They are, of course, a giant failure that neither provides easier access to capital for entrepreneurs nor generates any notable return for investors.\n    - **harhargange** (): Moreover, splitting the decision making is so conflict prone and unoptimised for competition. I had a look at some statistics that showed most successful startups take off when they have a single founder\n  - **yibg** (): This model also puts a lot of risk on the employees. It\u2019s basically forcing investment in the same company that pays your salary. An investment that has less liquidity than standard investments. It\u2019s like putting all your retirement fund into your company\u2019s stock.\n    - **whoknowsidont** (): &gt;It\u2019s like putting all your retirement fund into your company\u2019s stock.<p>As opposed to putting your retirement fund into other company&#x27;s stocks, which everyone does at the same time, making those companies too big too fail without unraveling several threads of social fabric.<p>I think your statement actually proves why employees should have stock in the company.<p>If we really were worried about issues such as this we&#x27;d have universal (not attached to you employer) healthcare and a pretty robust (but minimal) retire fund for citizens.<p>But we have the opposite of that with none of the upsides.\n    - **W3cUYxYwmXb5c** (): This is a very good and understated point. One of the benefits we have as employers is being unattached. If things go bad, we can cut and run to some other company. On the other hand, the owners and primary investors are by definition more invested, and have to actual bear the burden of failure. I definitely didn&#x27;t want that level of involvement in most of the companies I have worked for.\n    - **refurb** (): Precisely.<p>Seems to me the best option would be to <i>offer</i> employees ownership.  You could have two compensation structures:<p>- 100% cash compensation\n- 50% cash&#x2F;50% equity<p>See which ones employees prefer.  I&#x27;ll bet it&#x27;s overwhelmingly the first.\n- **xmprt** (): I think the most surprising thing about trends in modern executive class pay is just how steep it is compared to the median employee. It makes me wonder why shareholders outside the company are happy with it.<p>For example, the Boeing CEO made 22M in 2022 and 32M in 2023. I&#x27;d argue that he did a much worse job in 2023 than in 2022 but somehow got paid almost 50% more. Even Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, is &quot;only&quot; being paid $34M in 2024.\n  - **pjc50** (): The limit case is of course <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;antoniopequenoiv&#x2F;2024&#x2F;06&#x2F;13&#x2F;tesla-shareholders-greenlight-elon-musks-50-billion-pay-package&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;antoniopequenoiv&#x2F;2024&#x2F;06&#x2F;13&#x2F;tes...</a><p>It&#x27;s difficult to understand pay of that size on a rational level. That represents individual shareholders voting for a significant dilution just to retain an extremely controversial celebrity CEO at a time when sales are falling. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;article&#x2F;2024&#x2F;jul&#x2F;02&#x2F;tesla-second-quarter-sales\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;article&#x2F;2024&#x2F;jul&#x2F;02&#x2F;t...</a><p>I see this kind of thing more as &quot;how much the CEO is allowing himself to steal from the till because there&#x27;s nobody above him&quot; most of the time. Except in this case the shareholders really did make an expensive choice.\n    - **renewiltord** (): Worked out for me. I bought a bunch on the last time everyone claimed Tesla was dead and then voted to keep Elon. Up 28%. Everyone\u2019s got theories. I prefer money. What use are your theories if they don\u2019t predict the outcome.\n  - **roenxi** (): I doubt they are happy as much as disinterested. The economy has been heavily financialised, interest rates have been at 0% [0] and a big chunk of economic activity is government spending. Shareholders don&#x27;t appear to be worried about how the company actually runs in the details. What matters is that the CEO is positioning them to tap in to the money printing and borrowing game. IE, the wages suggest workers don&#x27;t really matter because they don&#x27;t. Profits will come from things like being in Crypto or AI booms at the right time.<p>It isn&#x27;t the be all and end all, but I&#x27;d rather be a shareholder in, say, a military production company with solid government contacts &amp; contracts than one with capable workers.<p>[0] Thank goodness that has finally changed but there is a bit of a lag while everyone catches up to the new normal.\n    - **graemep** (): I was going to say this. In addition to what you say a lot of shareholders are in i for the short term. They are interested in what the share price will do in the short term.<p>Directors remuneration mostly decided by other directors (and just approved by shareholders who are not bothered), who tend to take the view that it is worth paying directors very highly.<p>Its something that has got worse, but its not new. As GK Galbraith said &quot;The salary of the chief executive of a large corporation is not a market award for achievement. It is frequently in the nature of a warm personal gesture by the individual to himself.&quot;\n    - **eru** (): &gt; The economy has been heavily financialised, interest rates have been at 0% [0] and a big chunk of economic activity is government spending.<p>If you want to be dramatic: we had negative real interest rates for a long while.<p>Nominal interest rates were close to 0% and inflation was positive.<p>&gt; Shareholders don&#x27;t appear to be worried about how the company actually runs in the details.<p>And shareholders who are interested get vilified as activists or short sellers.<p>&gt; IE, the wages suggest workers don&#x27;t really matter because they don&#x27;t.<p>The labour share of GDP has been mostly stable for the last few decades between 55 to 65%-ish  See <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;LABSHPUSA156NRUG\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;LABSHPUSA156NRUG</a><p>Profits have also been fairly stable as a share of GDP at around 5-10%-ish: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;W273RE1A156NBEA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;W273RE1A156NBEA</a><p>Just to be clear: going up or down by 5% of GDP is a lot in absolute terms, but not enough to justify hyperbole about &quot;workers don&#x27;t matter&quot;.\n    - **AnthonyMouse** (): More to the point, Boeing&#x27;s revenue is over $16 billion. Some tens of millions are a rounding error when it&#x27;s only being paid to one person, and that is the real source of the disparity. Paying one CEO $32 million is two tenths of a percent of their revenue. If they tried to pay each of their 170,000 employees even 1% of that, it wouldn&#x27;t be 0.2% of their revenue, it would be &gt;300% of their revenue and they&#x27;d be out of business.<p>This, in turn, is caused by the size of the companies being so large.\n  - **strikelaserclaw** (): This phenomenon is a function of attributing all the positive developments within a company to the C-suite executives. Just as shareholders profit from the productive work of many employees, the C-suite executives often receive credit for the achievements of a large number of people. I think it is related to a fundamental characteristic of humans, that being we can&#x27;t understand information unless it is calculated into simpler versions ( concepts like medians, averages, variance, &quot;who is the best&quot;, &quot;who is the worst&quot;, &quot;who is the most evil&quot;, &quot;who is the least evil&quot; all come out of the same human need to get simplified answers). When credit and information moves up up the funnel from employees to c - suite, it gets  - credit gets assigned at higher and higher levels. It is not team xyz that did it, it is their manager, or their manager&#x27;s managers until it gets to the ceo who only knows that &quot;svp x was responsible for this successful product launch&quot; - since the people at the top determine pay scales, if theres 10-20 million to pay out in terms of increments, the board rewards the ceo with 10 million because he is apparently responsible for ALL the successful product launches, the ceo decides to reward svp with 2 million increment etc... It truly does pay to sit at the table with the decision makers.\n    - **joker99** (): I don\u2019t consider this being a bug. The big issue is: while they get the praise, they reject or pass on the blame to the employees.\n"}]}

The biggest influence on my report design has been, believe it or not, iTunes: no more padding than necessary, zebra striping, fast and easy sorting, and something like a column browser if possible.  I&#x27;ve been using DataTables happily for years.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve been experimenting with lately is sorting vs. showing.  If I&#x27;m pulling data from Jira, and an issue is blocked, do I need a separate boolean column to sort or filter, or is it enough to style another column (say, age)?  In a table with a hundred or more rows, will an orange, red, or bold red value in a single cell stand out enough for me to recognize something I need to address now?<p>Looking at the table view of this experiment, the things I like are:<p>* live updating<p>* stable sorting for multiple columns<p>* row highlight on hover<p>* dimming the trailing zeros<p>* colors aren&#x27;t overdone; basically just three pairs of colors<p>* graph in the 24H Low&#x2F;High column, kind of like a sparkline<p>The things that don&#x27;t land as well with me:<p>* horizontal scroll bar is almost invisible<p>* the wide vertical scroll bar with the graph<p>* how does 24H Low&#x2F;High actually sort?<p>* no filtering (although it may not be essential for this data source)<p>The other thing I notice, comparing this to some of my own reports, is that there isn&#x27;t much variance in the width of the values.

It seems to work well even with comprehensive UI frameworks on top of it like SB Admin Pro. Just super easy to integrate DataTables and has 90% of the features I ever want.\n- **pavlov** (): In my opinion this experiment is missing a key element of designing for UI density: typography.<p>These screens use a fixed-width font at a single size. It\u2019s a retro 1980 text-mode UI look, and it\u2019s fine if that was the design constraint they wanted.<p>But you can squeeze a lot more information on screen if you can have a proper hierarchy of typefaces and sizes.<p>(As a basic example, the \u201cAbout\u201d box now consumes almost a quarter of the screen on a phone. A change to a smaller proportional font could fit this information in half the space and still remain readable on a phone.)<p>If you look at the works of an accomplished information designer like Edward Tufte, he often obsesses about getting the typography right. His books use many typographic elements and scales even for the body text, outside of the visualizations.\n  - **skyyr** (): Have a particular work by Edward Tufte to recommend on the subject?\n    - **vismit2000** (): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edwardtufte.com&#x2F;bboard&#x2F;q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001Au\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edwardtufte.com&#x2F;bboard&#x2F;q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=...</a>\n- **btbuildem** (): I quite like how you extended the table scrollbar to carry extra information -- akin to a minimap in code editors. At a glance it helps orient the data on screen in context of the larger dataset.<p>The helix I find hard to read and not useful. These types of graphs are better suited for periodic data where the period is much shorter than the span of the dataset.<p>The cube made me curious, but I couldn&#x27;t quite see the advantage. Usually using a 3D viz is not as effective as using three 2D equivalent graphs (here would be 3 scatter plots) -- simply because the projection from 3D to 2D distorts things and messes with our innate ability to compare locations (and a bit less so, areas). What was the effect you were after here?\n  - **11001100** (): To clarify: I&#x27;m not the creator of this beautiful project.\n  - **localfirst** (): i actually just came here to comment on helix tab and how fcking amazing this is. For example, I can use this view to chart out volatility of stocks and other instruments especially derivatives I&#x27;d imagine.<p>Having a super natural way to peer into the past as much as possible while the more recent data are larger is pure fcking genius.

Great outcomes. There are still some workarounds that companies do to put this s..t out in the public (e.g. covers of renovation works can contain up to 50% of advertising area, so we have renovations of just finished buildings only to put the covers with ads). \nNow, when I visit another city when there&#x27;s no such ban I cannot stand this visual garbage.\nThis should be banned everywhere.\n  - **cromulent** (): On my visits to Warsaw, I have always been struck by the translucent advertising entirely covering the sides of new-ish office buildings.

It&#x27;s the same, or worse, in Romania.<p>It&#x27;s just rabid unregulated capitalism of the post communist countries, gone wild, where everything is about making as much money as possible any way you can, which means advertising everywhere so you can influence people to spend their money with you. Romania is now IRL what the internet looks like without ad block.<p>The ads for gambling and betting are the most nefarious, to the point it&#x27;s becoming a societal issue.\n    - **mantas** (): Up here in Lithuania we used to make fun of your billboards 20 years ago. But now it&#x27;s getting worse and worse here too. While you seem to have rebounded from the lowest point.\n  - **JumpCrisscross** (): &gt; <i>should be banned everywhere</i><p>Totally agree.

It is truly an audacious move, yet completely rational. My dream is to also ban parking of cars in neighborhoods and most car traffic, cars can be parked along the edges in solar covered parking spaces. Add car sharing, better public transportation, urban agriculture, community gardens and parks: soon you&#x27;ll have an efficient paradise of a city.<p>Unfortunately mayors of cities in the Netherlands do not have sufficient power to change rules like these, its the state which makes these rules. This is why we won&#x27;t see such a thing in my country. There are progressive cities where it could fly, but overall the Netherlands has become extremely conservative.\n  - **systemtest** (): The majority of people in The Netherlands drive their car to get to work. They don&#x27;t want to have to walk 10 minutes to an edge parking or city hub. If we want to lower cars in neighbourhoods, or want people to get rid of cars, our public transit system needs to be come a lot better first. If public transit was a good option to get to work for people, more people would use it.<p>For me going to work is either a 20 minute car ride, with parking right in front of my house and right in front of work. Or it is a 10 minute walk, 45 minute bus ride where I likely have to stand and then another 5 minute walk. And I can&#x27;t work past 20:00 because that&#x27;s my last bus. Make it so public transit is less than 20 minutes, goes 24&#x2F;7 and picks me up within 5 minutes walking of my home and I will use it.<p>And no I don&#x27;t even live in a village. Population of 140.000 people and I work in a city of 300.000.\n    - **gpm** (): &gt; The majority of people in The Netherlands drive their car to get to work<p>I was curious about the statistics for this, and it looks like <i>barely</i> not to me, according to this data: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbs.nl&#x2F;en-gb&#x2F;figures&#x2F;detail&#x2F;84710ENG\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbs.nl&#x2F;en-gb&#x2F;figures&#x2F;detail&#x2F;84710ENG</a> (the CSV you can download is much more readable than the table in the webpage)<p>0.44 trips&#x2F;person&#x2F;day travelling to&#x2F;from work total in 2023, 0.21 of those by car. 2023 is the first year where that is the case though.<p>Edit: If you go to the Dutch version of the data it includes another category for cars (commuting as a passenger in a car) that the English data omitted, with 0.01 of the trips. Moving it from &quot;majority not-by-car in 2023&quot; to &quot;rounding errors mean the data doesn&#x27;t say which is in the majority&quot;: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbs.nl&#x2F;nl-nl&#x2F;cijfers&#x2F;detail&#x2F;84710NED\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbs.nl&#x2F;nl-nl&#x2F;cijfers&#x2F;detail&#x2F;84710NED</a>\n    - **the_gipsy** (): &gt; If we want to lower cars in neighbourhoods, or want people to get rid of cars, our public transit system needs to be come a lot better first.<p>No, you can also start by imposing restrictions on cars.<p>&gt; If public transit was a good option to get to work for people, more people would use it.<p>The people that live in the city center probably already use public transit because, for them, public transit is probably a faster commute. That means that the cars congesting the center are driven by people that live in the periphery or even suburbs outside of the city.<p>So these people will want those nasty cars out, because they actually live there, and they will vote them out.<p>You can never accommodate the people from the suburbs, unless they have a station right next to their door and their office and a train coming every 5 minutes, a car will always be faster. They live in someone else&#x27;s municipality, so the mayors can just ignore them.<p>People in the periphery are more delicate, but usually they are also tired of congestions, and it&#x27;s much easier to make at least minor improvements to public transit for them.<p>But again, you can restrict and make improvements in parallel, and the improvement will almost never be perceived as matching the restrictions anyway.\n    - **tizzy** (): You guys are lucky in the NL that you have the _option_ to bike, drive, public transport. Maybe driving is still the fastest but the others are still treated as first class citizens.<p>In the US you couldn\u2019t realistically bike anywhere nor does public transport go everywhere. Not to mention the 10 minute walk to the bus stop is probably much worse, especially outside of big cities.\n  - **cchi_co** (): &gt; My dream is to also ban parking of cars in neighborhoods and most car traffic, cars can be parked along the edges in solar covered parking spaces. \nSome individuals, particularly those with disabilities or mobility issues, may find it challenging\n    - **ceejayoz** (): That seems like a good reason to ban &quot;most car traffic&quot; but not &quot;all car traffic&quot;, yes.\n  - **briandear** (): &gt; My dream is to also ban parking of cars in neighborhoods<p>So less freedom for residents?\n    - **breuleux** (): It&#x27;s not that simple. <i>Your</i> car increases your freedom, but everybody else&#x27;s cars decrease it. As a resident who does not have a car, cars impede my freedom to bike and jaywalk, they are unsightly and reduce visibility, they take up space that could be used for bike lanes, greenery, benches or terraces. It would be far more pleasant if there were far less of them.<p>I believe that Japan bans on-street parking and that you are not allowed to have a car unless you can prove that you have dedicated parking for it. That seems like a good model to me.\n    - **stetrain** (): Are those residents paying for the total cost of that parking? The space consumed, the opportunity costs averted, the safety cost of more cars driving through dense areas with pedestrians and cyclists?<p>If they are then that freedom is a valid choice. If they aren&#x27;t, then they&#x27;re being subsidized by public amenities, and the public can decide how those amenities should be used.\n"}]}

Compared to its predecessor, Mistral Large 2 is significantly more capable in code generation, mathematics, and reasoning. It also provides a much stronger multilingual support, and advanced function calling capabilities.\n\n*   July 24, 2024\n*   Mistral AI team\n\n![Detailed benchmarks](https://mistral.ai/images/news/mistral-large-2407/mistral-large-mini.png)\n\nThis latest generation continues to push the boundaries of cost efficiency, speed, and performance. Mistral Large 2 is exposed on la Plateforme and enriched with new features to facilitate building innovative AI applications.\n\n### Mistral Large 2\n\nMistral Large 2 has a 128k context window and supports dozens of languages including French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Arabic, Hindi, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, along with 80+ coding languages including Python, Java, C, C++, JavaScript, and Bash.\n\nMistral Large 2 is designed for single-node inference with long-context applications in mind \u2013 its size of 123 billion parameters allows it to run at large throughput on a single node. We are releasing Mistral Large 2 under the [Mistral Research License](https://mistral.ai/licenses/MRL-0.1.md)\n, that allows usage and modification for research and non-commercial usages. For commercial usage of Mistral Large 2 requiring self-deployment, a Mistral Commercial License must be acquired by [contacting us](/contact/)\n.\n\n##### General performance\n\nMistral Large 2 sets a new frontier in terms of performance / cost of serving on evaluation metrics. In particular, on MMLU, the pretrained version achieves an accuracy of 84.0%, and sets a new point on the performance/cost Pareto front of open models.\n\n##### Code & Reasoning\n\nFollowing our experience with [Codestral 22B](https://mistral.ai/news/codestral/)\n and [Codestral Mamba](https://mistral.ai/news/codestral-mamba/)\n, we trained Mistral Large 2 on a very large proportion of code. Mistral Large 2 vastly outperforms the previous Mistral Large, and performs on par with leading models such as GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, and Llama 3 405B.\n\n![Detailed benchmarks](https://mistral.ai/images/news/mistral-large-2407/mistral-large-2407-performance.png)\n\nA significant effort was also devoted to enhancing the model\u2019s reasoning capabilities. One of the key focus areas during training was to minimize the model\u2019s tendency to \u201challucinate\u201d or generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect or irrelevant information. This was achieved by fine-tuning the model to be more cautious and discerning in its responses, ensuring that it provides reliable and accurate outputs.\n\nAdditionally, the new Mistral Large 2 is trained to acknowledge when it cannot find solutions or does not have sufficient information to provide a confident answer. This commitment to accuracy is reflected in the improved model performance on popular mathematical benchmarks, demonstrating its enhanced reasoning and problem-solving skills:\n\n![Detailed benchmarks](https://mistral.ai/images/news/mistral-large-2407/mistral-large-2407-code-generation.png)\n\nPerformance accuracy on code generation benchmarks (all models were benchmarked through the same evaluation pipeline)\n\n![Detailed benchmarks](https://mistral.ai/images/news/mistral-large-2407/mistral-large-2407-multiple.png)\n\nPerformance accuracy on MultiPL-E (all models were benchmarked through the same evaluation pipeline, except for the \"paper\" row)\n\n![Detailed benchmarks](https://mistral.ai/images/news/mistral-large-2407/mistral-large-2407-code-generation-2.png)\n\nPerformance accuracy on GSM8K (8-shot) and MATH (0-shot, no CoT) generation benchmarks (all models were benchmarked through the same evaluation pipeline)\n\n##### Instruction following & Alignment\n\nWe drastically improved the instruction-following and conversational capabilities of Mistral Large 2. The new Mistral Large 2 is particularly better at following precise instructions and handling long multi-turn conversations. Below we report the performance on MT-Bench, Wild Bench, and Arena Hard benchmarks:\n\n![Detailed benchmarks](https://mistral.ai/images/news/mistral-large-2407/mistral-large-2407-instruction.png)\n\nPerformance on general alignment benchmarks (all models were benchmarked through the same evalutation pipeline)\n\nOn some benchmarks, generating lengthy responses tends to improve the scores. However, in many business applications, conciseness is paramount \u2013 short model generations facilitate quicker interactions and are more cost-effective for inference. This is why we spent a lot of effort to ensure that generations remain succinct and to the point whenever possible. The graph below reports the average length of generations of different models on questions from the MT Bench benchmark:\n\n![MT Bench benchmarks](https://mistral.ai/images/news/mistral-large-2407/mistral-large-2407-mtbench.png)\n\n##### Language diversity\n\nA large fraction of business use cases today involve working with multilingual documents. While the majority of models are English-centric, the new Mistral Large 2 was trained on a large proportion of multilingual data. In particular, it excels in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, and Hindi. Below are the performance results of Mistral Large 2 on the multilingual MMLU benchmark, compared to the previous Mistral Large, Llama 3.1 models, and to Cohere\u2019s Command R+.\n\n![Detailed benchmarks](https://mistral.ai/images/news/mistral-large-2407/mistral-large-2407-mmlu.png)\n\n![Detailed benchmarks](https://mistral.ai/images/news/mistral-large-2407/mistral-large-2407-language-diversity.png)\n\nPerformance on Multilingual MMLU (measured on the base pretrained model)\n\n##### Tool Use & Function Calling\n\nMistral Large 2 is equipped with enhanced function calling and retrieval skills and has undergone training to proficiently execute both parallel and sequential function calls, enabling it to serve as the power engine of complex business applications.\n\n![Detailed benchmarks](https://mistral.ai/images/news/mistral-large-2407/mistral-large-2407-tool-use.png)\n\n##### Try Mistral Large 2 on la Plateforme\n\nYou can use Mistral Large 2 today via [la Plateforme](https://console.mistral.ai/)\n under the name `mistral-large-2407`, and test it on le Chat. It is available under the version 24.07 (a YY.MM versioning system that we are applying to all our models), and the API name `mistral-large-2407`.

Mistral AI\u2019s best models are now available on Vertex AI, in addition to Azure AI Studio, Amazon Bedrock and IBM watsonx.ai.\n\n##### Availability timeline of Mistral AI models\n\n![Detailed benchmarks](https://mistral.ai/images/news/mistral-large-2407/mistral-large-2407-availability.png)\n\n-----\nGenerate comments in a hierarchical structure with 3 comments per level, up to a depth of 3."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n- **tikkun** (): Links to chat with models that released this week:<p>Large 2 - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.mistral.ai&#x2F;chat\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.mistral.ai&#x2F;chat</a><p>Llama 3.1 405b - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.llama2.ai&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.llama2.ai&#x2F;</a><p>I just tested Mistral Large 2 and Llama 3.1 405b on 5 prompts from my Claude history.<p>I&#x27;d rank as:<p>1. Sonnet 3.5<p>2. Large 2 and Llama 405b (similar, no clear winner between the two)<p>If you&#x27;re using Claude, stick with it.<p>My Claude wishlist:<p>1. Smarter (yes, it&#x27;s the most intelligent, and yes, I wish it was far smarter still)<p>2. Longer context window (1M+)<p>3. Native audio input including tone understanding<p>4. Fewer refusals and less moralizing when refusing<p>5. Faster<p>6. More tokens in output\n  - **campers** (): It seems to be the way with these releases, sticking with Claude, at least for the &#x27;hard&#x27; tasks. In my agent platform I have LLMs assigned for easy&#x2F;medium&#x2F;hard categorised tasks, which was somewhat inspired from the Claude 3 release with Haiku&#x2F;Sonnet&#x2F;Opus. GPT4-mini has bumped Haiku for the easy category for now. Sonnet 3.5 bumped Opus for the hard category, so I could possibly downgrade the medium tasks from Sonnet 3.5 to Mistral Large 2 if the price is right on the platforms with only 123b params compared to 405b. I was surprised how much Llama3 405b was on together.ai $5&#x2F;mil for input&#x2F;output! I&#x27;ll stick to Sonnet 3.5. Then I was also surprised how much cheaper Fireworks was at $3&#x2F;mil<p>Gemini has two aces up its sleeve now with the long context and now the context caching for 75% reduced input token cost. I was looking at the &quot;Improved Facuality and Reasoning in Language Models through Multi-agent debate&quot; paper the other days, and thought Gemini would have a big cost advantage implementing this technique with the context caching. If only Google could get their model up to the level of Anthropic.\n  - **drewnick** (): All 3 models you ranked cannot get &quot;how many r&#x27;s are in strawberry?&quot; correct.  They all claim 2 r&#x27;s unless you press them.  With all the training data I&#x27;m surprised none of them fixed this yet.\n    - **Kuinox** (): Tokenization make it hard for it to count the letters, that&#x27;s also why if you ask it to do maths, writing the number in letters will yield better results.<p>for strawberry, it see it as [496, 675, 15717], which is str aw berry.<p>If you insert characters to breaks the tokens down, it find the correct result: \nhow many r&#x27;s are in &quot;s&quot;t&quot;r&quot;a&quot;w&quot;b&quot;e&quot;r&quot;r&quot;y&quot; ?<p>&gt; There are 3 &#x27;r&#x27;s in &quot;s&quot;t&quot;r&quot;a&quot;w&quot;b&quot;e&quot;r&quot;r&quot;y&quot;.\n    - **generalizations** (): Testing models on their tokenization has always struck me as kinda odd. Like, that has nothing to do with their intelligence.\n    - **tikkun** (): When using a prompt that involves thinking first, all three get it correct.<p>&quot;Count how many rs are in the word strawberry. First, list each letter and indicate whether it&#x27;s an r and tally as you go, and then give a count at the end.&quot;<p>Llama 405b: correct<p>Mistral Large 2: correct<p>Claude 3.5 Sonnet: correct\n  - **qwertox** (): Claude needs to fix their text input box. It tries to be so advanced that code in backticks gets reformatted, and when you copy it, the formatting is lost (even the backticks).\n    - **nickthesick** (): They are using Tiptap for their input and just a couple of days ago we called them out on some perf improvements that could be had in their editor: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41036078\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41036078</a><p>I am curious what you mean by the formatting is lost though?\n    - **cpursley** (): Claude is truly incredible but I&#x27;m so tired of the JavaScript bloat everywhere. Just why. Both theirs and ChatGPTs UIs are hot garbage when it comes to performance (I constantly have to clear my cache and have even relegated them to a different browser entirely). Not everyone has an M4, and if we did - we&#x27;d probably just run our own models.\n    - **spaceship__sun** (): Hardly a day passes without ML progress...405B dethroned in ONE DAY\n- **TIPSIO** (): This race for the top model is getting wild. Everyone is claiming to one-up each with every version.<p>My experience (benchmarks aside) Claude 3.5 Sonnet absolutely blows everything away.<p>I&#x27;m not really sure how to even test&#x2F;use Mistral or Llama for everyday use though.\n  - **satvikpendem** (): I stopped my ChatGPT subscription and subscribed instead to Claude, it&#x27;s simply much better. But, it&#x27;s hard to tell how much better day to day beyond my main use cases of coding. It is more that I felt ChatGPT felt degraded than Claude were much better. The hedonic treadmill runs deep.\n    - **bugglebeetle** (): GPT-4 was probably as good as Claude Sonnet 3.5 at its outset, but OpenAI ran it into the ground with whatever they\u2019re doing to save on inference costs, otherwise scale, align it, or add dumb product features.\n    - **bionhoward** (): Claude\u2019s license is too insane, you can\u2019t use it for anything that competes with the everything thing.<p>Not sure what folks who accept Anthropic license are thinking after they read the terms.<p>Seems they didn\u2019t read the terms, and they aren\u2019t thinking? (Wouldn\u2019t you want outputs you could use to compete with intelligence??? What are you thinking after you read their terms?)\n    - **TIPSIO** (): Have you (or anyone) swapped on Cursor with Anthropic API Key?<p>For coding assistant, it&#x27;s on my to do list to try. Cursor needs some serious work on model selection clarity though so I keep putting off.\n  - **coder543** (): &gt; I&#x27;m not really sure how to even test&#x2F;use Mistral or Llama for everyday use though.<p>Both Mistral and Meta offer their own hosted versions of their models to try out.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.mistral.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.mistral.ai</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.ai</a><p>You have to sign into the first one to do anything at all, and you have to sign into the second one if you want access to the new, larger 405B model.<p>Llama 3.1 is certainly going to be available through other platforms in a matter of days. Groq supposedly offered Llama 3.1 405B yesterday, but I never once got it to respond, and now it\u2019s just gone from their website. Llama 3.1 70B does work there, but 405B is the one that\u2019s supposed to be comparable to GPT-4o and the like.\n    - **espadrine** (): meta.ai is inaccessible in a large portion of world territories, but the Llama 3.1 70B and 405B are also available in <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hf.co&#x2F;chat\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hf.co&#x2F;chat</a><p>Additionally, all Llama 3.1 models are available in <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.together.ai&#x2F;playground&#x2F;chat&#x2F;meta-llama&#x2F;Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-Turbo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.together.ai&#x2F;playground&#x2F;chat&#x2F;meta-llama&#x2F;Meta-Llam...</a> and in <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fireworks.ai&#x2F;models&#x2F;fireworks&#x2F;llama-v3p1-405b-instruct\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fireworks.ai&#x2F;models&#x2F;fireworks&#x2F;llama-v3p1-405b-instru...</a> by logging in.\n    - **d13** (): Groq\u2019s models are also heavily quantised so you won\u2019t get the full experience there.\n  - **harlanlewis** (): To help keep track of the race, I put together a simple dashboard to visualize model&#x2F;provider leaders in capability, throughput, and cost.

Winamp skins are actually just zip files with a different file extension, so I tried extracting their files to see what I could find.\n\nThis ended up leading me down a series of wild rabbit holes where I found:\n\n*   Encrypted files which I was able to crack to discover their secrets\n    \n*   A gift a dad in Thailand had made for his two and a half year old son, but didn\u2019t want published online\n    \n*   Somebody\u2019s email password\n    \n*   A secret biography of Chet Baker\n    \n*   Cryptic backwards audio files\n    \n*   A file called `worm.exe` which held quite the surprise\n    \n*   A host of extremely random images and files\n    \n*   56 previously unknown Winamp skins hidden inside other Winamp skins!\n    \n\nThis all aligned perfectly with my love of [Winamp](https://jordaneldredge.com/tag/winamp/)\n, my love of [found items](https://jordaneldredge.com/tag/found/)\n and was enabled by storing all the data I have about these skins [in an sqlite database](https://twitter.com/captbaritone/status/1535471373191028737)\n (as [discussed on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31703874)\n).\n\nHere\u2019s the story:\n\n* * *\n\nThe first corrupted file I looked at was called `Wicked_Ways.wsz` and contained just a PDF advertising a rentable bowling pin mascot costume:\n\n![](https://jordaneldredge.com/notion-mirror/84ebb48c-616a-4f51-ae9a-991a4e0a7e9b/e94461bd-1f9c-4ef4-bbda-23acc32ef0df/EsErCPFVoAACjOn.jpeg)\n\nI\u2019m particularly curious about what exactly a \u201c\u2019Kool\u2019 Tube\u201d is. Some mechanism for keeping the occupant from overheating I assume?\n\n* * *\n\nAnother was called `bobs_car.wsz` and, as advertised, contained just this picture, which I have to assume is the titular \u201cBob\u2019s car\u201d.\n\n![](https://jordaneldredge.com/notion-mirror/84ebb48c-616a-4f51-ae9a-991a4e0a7e9b/02d049fc-ee84-42b7-95f1-52c4c434db63/bobs_car.jpg)\n\n_Update 2024/7/25:_ Someone on Hacker News [identified](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41065196)\n this location as [Kilmacolm Road Viewpoint](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kilmacolm+Road+Viewpoint/@55.9285659,-4.7106362,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1sAF1QipPpt-joyGwDUQF1ZE44AaDN6NFZbmd87LGrERqZ!2e10!3e12!6shttps:%2F%2Fgz0.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipPpt-joyGwDUQF1ZE44AaDN6NFZbmd87LGrERqZ%3Dw414-h552-k-no!7i3024!8i4032!4m7!3m6!1s0x4889b105a0b0d8bf:0xf62aa0cffb734fbe!8m2!3d55.9285659!4d-4.7106362!10e5!16s%2Fg%2F11fpn_qb67?entry=ttu)\n in Scotland.\n\n* * *\n\nBut then things got interesting. I found one that was an encrypted zip archive.\n\n[resubmitted.2003\\_rsx.wsz](https://capt.dev/file/TCIZp9O6FQBS51QrxWj1d/resubmitted.2003_acura_rsx.wsz)\n\nI took the opportunity to learn about tools for brute forcing passwords in zip files. Soon enough, I cracked it, and found its contents:\n\n![](https://jordaneldredge.com/notion-mirror/84ebb48c-616a-4f51-ae9a-991a4e0a7e9b/7371ccc8-08f3-4202-b955-39ba04f31394/Screen_Shot_2021-01-18_at_10.46.36_PM.png)\n\nThe password was \"honda\u201d. No idea why it might have been encrypted. You can find the decrypted version [here](https://skins.webamp.org/skin/79dd58bc6e30f5a260f7aefd631d8ea2/2003_acura_rsx.updated.wsz/)\n.\n\n* * *\n\nThe next one contained a Flintstones [rule 34](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_34)\n image, which I won\u2019t include here for obvious reasons.\n\n* * *\n\nAnother one had been created by a dad in Thailand who made an Adobe Illustrator mock up illustration of a Winamp skin he had designed as a gift to his two and a half year old son. But he didn't know how to make it a skin, so he sent it to [winamp.com](http://winamp.com/)\n (along with a text file letter) asking that it be made into a skin that he could use. The letter was very touching but he asked them not to share the skin, so I have not included it here.\n\n* * *\n\nI found another encrypted zip file. This time the password was not in my wordlist. After a bit of fiddling with the cracking tool\u2019s config file, I was able to brute force it as well. The result was a valid Winamp skin!\n\n![](https://jordaneldredge.com/notion-mirror/84ebb48c-616a-4f51-ae9a-991a4e0a7e9b/4d300a93-0973-42bf-8eff-43d2b4b33d94/Screen_Shot_2021-01-19_at_4.12.13_PM.png)\n\nPassword was \"nayane\u201d.\n\nI went ahead and uploaded the decrypted version [here](https://skins.webamp.org/skin/e880983b4c4597570b72041cb3dfac19/NIKE%20V10.wsz/)\n.\n\n* * *\n\nThis got me interested in other \u201csensitive\u201d things that might be included in skins, so I started searching for things like \u201cpassword\u201d inside the files _inside_ all the Winamp skins.\n\nI found one with a file called `E-mail passwords.txt` which contained\u2026 their email address and email password. Not great operational security.\n\n* * *\n\n[Another skin](https://skins.webamp.org/skin/bf47d3cee462143bb4549fee59f567b2/Marshall_Matters_Skin_2.wsz/)\n contained a text file with hundreds of blank lines and then, at the very bottom, the text:\n\n`                  YOU HAVE FOUND THE SUPRISE!!!

I was hugely into the scene of making&#x2F;releasing skins for any&#x2F;every program that included the ability (and a bunch that didn\u2019t, thanks to unsigned applications).<p>To this day I\u2019m the type to customise everything I own and I despise staring at generic looking programs all day. It\u2019s even worse when it\u2019s stuff like Discord that has a very opinionated style that won\u2019t even respect the small amount of customisation my Linux theming gives me.<p>I feel like a huge reason the indie web died off was OSes and programs limiting user customisation which was a gateway drug for many.  MySpace themes would get people learning html&#x2F;css. Winamp skins got people learning photoshop&#x2F;graphics. mIRC scripting taught people basic coding. OS customising had all of it.  Now you just shut up and use it as they dictate.\n  - **donatj** (): I truly miss working in software in the early 2000&#x27;s. We were all using XP but it was all customized up the wazoo. Almost all of us had custom themes and icons and what not.<p>I ran a Mac at home, and had that customized as well, I forget the name of the app that would install custom themes&#x2F;docks, but CandyBar would install custom icon sets.<p>Now days most people don&#x27;t even bother to change their wallpaper.

I, in no small part, owe my career as a software dev to falling in love with Linux because of the ability to theme everything, apps, desktops, ui toolkits.<p>Of course, this was back in the kde3 and gnome(2?) days. It\u2019s different now, it seems like theming has become actively discouraged, especially in Gnome.<p>It makes me sad wondering how many young creative people the community is missing an opportunity to captivate.\n  - **JohnMakin** (): There&#x27;s another benefit to opening this kind of functionality to apps - it&#x27;s very friendly towards developing interfaces that are more friendly to the disabled. I have certain disabilities where specific types of UI designs are basically unusable to me, and without the ability to customize them, I kinda just cannot use them (unless they provide an API as an alternative).\n    - **gorlilla** (): Until they rug-pull the API access that countless third parties built those accessibility features around....\n- **locusofself** (): I loved reading this.

It is similar to scientific research, the only difference being that scientific research is conducted into a natural phenomenon.\n\nWhew, that was quite a mouthful, wasn't it? Well, it is one of the main reasons why this tutorial set exists. To make reverse engineering _as simple as possible._\n\n![](https://0xinfection.github.io/reversing/cover.png)\n\nThis comprehensive set of reverse engineering tutorials covers x86, x64 as well as 32-bit ARM and 64-bit architectures. If you're a newbie looking to learn reversing, or just someone looking to revise on some concepts, you're at the right place. As a beginner, these tutorials will carry you from nothing upto the mid-basics of reverse engineering, a skill that everyone within the realm of cyber-security should possess. If you're here just to refresh some concepts, you can conveniently use the side bar to take a look at the sections that has been covered so far.\n\nYou can get the entire tutorial set in PDF or MOBI format. All these ebook versions will get updated automatically as new tutorials will be added.\n\nDownload here: \\[ [PDF](reversing-for-everyone.pdf)\\\n | [MOBI](reversing-for-everyone.mobi)\\\n \\]\n\n  \n\nGitbook crafted with \u2661 by [@0xInfection](https://twitter.com/0xInfection)\n\nresults matching \"\"\n===================\n\nNo results matching \"\"\n======================\n\n-----\nGenerate comments in a hierarchical structure with 3 comments per level, up to a depth of 3."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n- **amiga386** (): I&#x27;d like to add that reverse engineering can also be done without any peeking at the thing you&#x27;re trying to reverse-engineer.<p>Andrew Tridgell explaining how he reverse engineered Microsoft&#x27;s SMB protocol with the &quot;French cafe technique&quot;: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.samba.org&#x2F;ftp&#x2F;tridge&#x2F;misc&#x2F;french_cafe.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.samba.org&#x2F;ftp&#x2F;tridge&#x2F;misc&#x2F;french_cafe.txt</a><p>Tridge also reverse engineered BitKeeper, the proprietary software that Linus foolishly used to host Linux kernel development for a while.

It gave Larry McVoy unwarranted control over Linux kernel developers.<p>As rms said at the time: &quot;The spirit of the Bitkeeper license is the spirit of the whip hand. It is the spirit that says, &quot;You have no right to use Bitkeeper, only temporary privileges that we can revoke. Be grateful that we allow you to use Bitkeeper. Be grateful, and don&#x27;t do anything we dislike, or we may revoke those privileges.&quot; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marc.info&#x2F;?l=linux-kernel&amp;m=103454948625224&amp;w=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marc.info&#x2F;?l=linux-kernel&amp;m=103454948625224&amp;w=2</a><p>It caused animosity for years and was resolved by Linus writing git, famously in 10 days. Could he not have taken 10 days off in 2002 and written his preferred DVCS <i>then</i>?<p>The moral of the story is: don&#x27;t use proprietary software. It will bite you in the ass.<p>&quot;Torvalds seems to have fallen for the \u201cfree beer\u201d argument: He didn\u2019t have to pay for BitKeeper, so he figured it was good enough. But not having to pay is not, and has never been, the real purpose of free software. The point is to avoid the situation Torvalds eventually found himself in: McVoy didn\u2019t like how his product was being used, so he took his ball and went home.

You don&#x27;t need a copyright license to connect to an open network port and interrogate it (or even capture packets of other people&#x27;s conversations). US courts have also affirmed that web-scraping is a legal way to collect information <i>because</i> you&#x27;re just throwing the data out there to anyone who asks; if you want to force people to agree to terms and conditions to see data or &quot;use&quot; web-software, you have to make them login or supply a key that you only issue _after_ they agree to your license or contract.<p>Andrew Tridgell did not even <i>use</i> anything which would require him to accede to Larry&#x27;s license. It wrecked Larry&#x27;s desire that nobody work on a &quot;competing&quot; tool to his, and there was nothing he could do about it, which is why he took his ball and went home.\n    - **rustybolt** (): &gt; Clearly, talking to some software over the network is &#x27;using&#x27; it?<p>In some sense, yes. But I wouldn&#x27;t say my mom uses Linux when she uses her Ipad to visit a website hosted on a Linux server.\n  - **actionfromafar** (): So Andrew saved us not only once, but twice!<p>It goes to show that yes, you need someone to score, but you also need someone to make that critical pass of the ball.\n  - **tsujamin** (): An undergrad highlight for me was hearing the bitkeeper&#x2F;git story from Tridge one afternoon that he happened to be in the faculty lunch room :)\n- **llmblockchain** (): I never thought of reversing as something you pick up a book for. Everything I learned was through application from a young age.<p>1. Learning how to use Cheat Engine to scan video game process memory and modify games.<p>2. Learned how to read&#x2F;replay packets in an MMO to try an cheat.<p>3. Learned how to craft DLLs, hooks and inject them in processes.<p>4. Learned how create patches for executables to solve some crackme challenges.<p>5. Mess with real world software that requires a license key, to suddenly not require a license key (or accept any key).<p>6. Mess with binary formats to try an reverse how game saves worked to.. you guessed it, cheat.<p>7. Get a real job and make money with the skills and knowledge I acquired.\n  - **chc4** (): Same. I learned reverse engineering by staring at CE&#x2F;IDA for entirely too many hours as a kid, which means whenever someone asks me for advice on how to learn reverse engineering I don&#x27;t really have any good answers :)<p>I think in reality it&#x27;s the type of thing you do just have to try and spend some time on. The OP tutorial comes across as very sparse, both trying to cover too much and also not really teaching reverse engineering skills more than most people would be able to pick up in a few hours of messing around. beginners.re in contrast is massive, but also much more in-depth and goes step-by-step; on the other hand crackmes are probably better hands on challenges to try.\n    - **dinobones** (): Wow, did you really have access to IDA as a kid? Even with adult money it seems expensive to me.\n  - **boricj** (): Going straight for reverse-engineering is doable, but it&#x27;s significantly harder without some engineering background, either formal or self-taught.<p>I have an ongoing reverse-engineering project for a video game and I ended up getting in contact with a self-taught modder of the game, who doesn&#x27;t know how to program. He learned more in a couple of evening Discord calls with me showing him around the reverse-engineered Ghidra project, explaining the basics of computer program engineering as we went, than he did flipping bits with Cheat Engine.<p>He then proceeded to recreate a fairly ambitious mod that was showcased in a Youtube video 15 years ago but never released, something that was bugging him for <i>years</i> but was unable to recreate. I steered him throughout, but by seeing how the pieces fit together he then managed to do the same mod on the sequel (which was never done before) all by himself.<p>Experience with engineering gives you perspective when reverse-engineering.\n    - **doix** (): It depends what you mean by &quot;engineering&quot;. You need to understand the &quot;memory model&quot; (I don&#x27;t know the proper term). So that memory has addresses, you can point to them, the stack, registers, etc.<p>I have met many software developers that have almost no understanding about that stuff. They wouldn&#x27;t help much when it comes to reverse engineering.<p>At the end of the day, there&#x27;s a bunch of knowledge you need to be able to reverse engineer efficiently. It doesn&#x27;t really matter if you&#x27;re coming from flipping bits in CE to programming or vice versa, but you need both. Having some around that knows both guiding you is a massive help.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I also started reverse engineering first and programming second. There were many concepts I knew but didn&#x27;t know the name of. I remember seeing a weird function where a pointer to an object was passed via ecx. I had no idea that how functions were called was a &quot;calling convention&quot; and that Microsoft called that a __thiscall. But at the end of the day, I did figure out what was going on, I just couldn&#x27;t tell you what the original c++ code was until years later (when I finally &quot;learned&quot; c++).\n    - **deleted** (): \n    - **chc4** (): I don&#x27;t think this is true, or at least I&#x27;m not convinced by a single anecdote. The majority of good reverse engineers I know picked up reverse engineering first and programming second (and a lot of them are still frankly not great programmers), and likewise I know plenty of good programmers who would be completely lost reverse engineering. Reverse engineering is a very different skillset than programming.\n  - **pkoird** (): You entirely underestimate the power of structured learning and reinforcing exercises. While critical reasoning, curiosity, and passion are things that may be difficult to impart, a well-written book can cut hours of trial and error to something suitably reasonable. Notice that there are plenty of books but there are only a handful of &quot;good&quot; books.\n    - **llmblockchain** (): Structured learning is great, but I think you&#x27;re over estimating the power of books. Especially in a domain like reverse engineering. The moment a book is published it&#x27;s out of date. What worked yesterday doesn&#x27;t work tomorrow.<p>I never suggested people learn entirely on their own. I learned in a loosely structured way by reading thousands of forum posts, asking questions on forums, sitting in IRC channels talking to people, etc.\n- **armitron** (): I found so many mistakes, badly understood concepts and entirely wrong explanations just reading for 5 minutes, that I can&#x27;t possibly recommend this. It&#x27;s obviously written by amateurs &#x2F; people with minimal experience of the domain.<p>Much better resources are Eldad Eilam&#x27;s &quot;Secrets of Reverse Engineering&quot;, for Windows &quot;Practical Reverse Engineering&quot; and for the absolute basics, Patterson&#x27;s &quot;Computer Organization and Design&quot;.\n  - **optymizer** (): Secrets of Reverse Engineering is from 2005.

It is less suited for implementing back-end algorithms. I guess I wish for a similar tool which can also handle the back-end (in the context of my data processing job).<p>The problem is that I don&#x27;t know myself what UI I would actually want for a &quot;canvas-based editor&quot;.

Most importantly, no tree navigation.<p>If I need to jump to a file, I either use recents menu in Intellij or use file markers to jump to it, means I have to remember the filemarker and have intent to go there (I&#x27;m using IdeaVim plugin for vim hotkeys).

I need it as Idea plugin.<p>- creating layouts is the part I hate. Perhaps some AI that takes Git patches, or bug fixes and creates layout based on that.<p>- sharing layouts needs to be super easy<p>- integrate Git history as another dimensions.

Let me prove to you reading it _will_ actually have some payoff:\n\n[![See, I wrote something!](https://martin.janiczek.cz/assets/images/2024-07-23-taking-my-diabetes-treatment-into-my-own-hands/04-original-and-best.png)](/assets/images/2024-07-23-taking-my-diabetes-treatment-into-my-own-hands/04-original-and-best.png)\n\nOK, now that you\u2019ll stay, let\u2019s start from the beginning\u2026\n\n* * *\n\nI\u2019m a Type 1 diabetic. This means my pancreas doesn\u2019t produce insulin (which allows cells to use blood glucose for energy) and I have to provide it externally.\n\nThis is a finnicky process, because you need to balance your glucose in the right \u201czone\u201d - not too high (hyperglycemia, >10 mmol/l, is a long-term danger to your body) and not too low (hypoglycemia, <4 mmol/l, is a short-term danger to your body). If it\u2019s too high, you need to inject insulin, and if it\u2019s too low, you need to eat some sugars.\n\nA commonly used metaphor for this is flying a plane. There are games illustrating the process as well: click blue button, bird flies down, click orange button, bird flies up. Too high bad, too low bad, just right good.\n\n[![A game showing the process](https://martin.janiczek.cz/assets/images/2024-07-23-taking-my-diabetes-treatment-into-my-own-hands/icarus.png)](/assets/images/2024-07-23-taking-my-diabetes-treatment-into-my-own-hands/icarus.png)\n\nThe issues with manually managing this process you\u2019ve inherited from your douchebag pancreas are manifold:\n\n*   the insulin doesn\u2019t act immediately, there\u2019s around 20min delay (depending on the brand) before your blood glucose goes down\n*   the _food_ doesn\u2019t act immediately, there\u2019s around 20min delay (depending on the food!) before your blood glucose goes up\n    *   simple sugars (eg. fruit) are faster (and stop acting faster as well)\n    *   complex sugars (rice / potatoes / \u2026) are slower. You usually want your blood glucose as constant and flat as possible. The worst thing you can do is to go from hypo to hyper to hypo to hyper in huge amplitude swings.\n    *   fats also somehow affect the digestion of sugars. I can\u2019t be bothered to remember how, I just ignore them honestly.\n*   injecting insulin ~15min before you start eating would do _wonders_ for neutralizing the BG spike, the issue is, nobody does it, because what if you then get a smaller serving at the restaurant or it gets delayed? What if you get called somewhere urgently and can\u2019t finish your meal? People usually inject right before the meal / after the meal as a result.\n*   there\u2019s no generic formula (that I know of) for estimating how much will a gram of sugar increase your blood glucose, nor how much will an unit of insulin decrease your blood glucose. _It\u2019s all vibes._\n*   mathematical models _do_ exist but you need to find your body\u2019s parameters - I\u2019ll get to it below!\n*   the body has its own emergency reserves of glucose, which it can sometimes decide to use (though beware, this system turns off when you\u2019re drunk), so _maybe_ the Snickers bar you just ate to save your life wasn\u2019t actually needed anymore, and you end up with a hyper\n*   you\u2019re not quite yourself during a hypo (you get slower, dumber, I\u2019ve heard of people getting stuck in thought loops in front of an open fridge), and so even though you intellectually know you just ate enough to get back into the correct levels _eventually_, your brain is screaming at you **\u201cEAT! YOU\u2019RE DYING! I AM LOW ON SUGAR _NOW!!_\u201c** and in my case this leads to overcompensating quite knowingly and willingly. _Yeah one more yoghurt can\u2019t hurt._ Well\u2026\n*   insulin doesn\u2019t work when eaten, you need to inject yourself with it (though nowadays we do it under skin, not into veins, I sure am glad I\u2019m not living 50 years ago) or inhale it. Since injections aren\u2019t the most pleasant thing in the world, the dosage is usually limited to 4x a day (to counteract the three main meals + a long-acting different type of insulin once a day), even though you\u2019d be more stable if you injected more often, with smaller doses.\n    *   (no experience with inhalations here, so I\u2019ll skip this)\n    *   (insulin pumps do exist, I\u2019ll mention those briefly in a moment\u2026 maybe)\n*   measuring your blood glucose level is painful if you are using test strips and need to prick your fingers to provide a blood drop, so measuring your sugar is usually limited to 4-6x a day \u2013 again, even though it would be better to have more data points.\n    *   this is less of a problem nowadays with Continuous Glucose Monitoring systems like Freestyle Libre, which you install into your arm once every 14 days and get a measurement every minute through Bluetooth to your phone\n*   things like physical effort, illness, stress, _heck, even seasons of the year_ do all affect how your body behaves and reacts to sugar / insulin\n*   there\u2019s this damn thing called [dawn phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_phenomenon)\n     that some diabetics, me included, experience: in the morning your sugar will just start going up and up. If you wanted to sleep in on the weekend, well tough luck, you\u2019re now in the 15 mmol/l range.\n\nI hope this incomplete list gives you an idea of how wonky the process of trying to make your blood glucose stay in the right levels is.\n\n[![My 7-day average](https://martin.janiczek.cz/assets/images/2024-07-23-taking-my-diabetes-treatment-into-my-own-hands/phone.jpeg)](/assets/images/2024-07-23-taking-my-diabetes-treatment-into-my-own-hands/phone.jpeg)\n\nMy treatment is usually: keep the Freestyle Libre app on my phone open as much as possible and when I see my BG\u2019s getting high, I inject a small amount of insulin. How much? No idea. _IT\u2019S ALL VIBES._\n\nBut sometimes the app is yelling at you: \u201cyou\u2019re at 15 mmol/l for an hour now, idiot!\u201d and you just don\u2019t (want to) pay attention. Alert fatigue is a real thing.\n\nI have some recommended insulin dosages that we\u2019ve settled on with my diabetologist, whom I visit every three months. So my regimen can look like:\n\n*   Breakfast: inject 18 units, eat 24g of sugars\n*   Lunch: inject 22 units, eat 60g of sugars\n*   Dinner: inject 21 units, eat 60g of sugars\n*   Before sleep: inject 32 units of long-acting insulin\n\nAnd then I see my diabetologist, she looks at the 7d / 14d / 30d averages and says \u201cmaybe you can try fixing the 15:00 hypers you\u2019re getting quite regularly, by injecting more insulin before lunch. You should also lose weight, when you started coming here you had 80kg, now you\u2019re a centurion. Like seriously, WTF. OK cool bye, see you in 3 months!\u201d\n\nLovely.\n\nIf you can\u2019t tell, the thing that irks me the most about the whole thing is: _I\u0337\u031b\u0308\u030f\u0360\u0340\u031b\u030a\u032eT\u0335\u035d\u030f\u0328\u0321\u2019\u0335\u0310\u0302\u0311\u0344\u0350\u0310\u035c\u034d\u0327S\u0338\u035d\u0352\u0315\u0308\u0340\u0349\u0316 \u0334\u0341\u033a\u0324\u031c\u034e\u0322\u035a\u0319A\u0337\u0309\u030a\u0323\u0355\u0331\u0356\u0359L\u0334\u0305\u0344\u033c\u031e\u033a\u0324\u031e\u032c\u031fL\u0337\u0314\u030f\u0310\u0303\u031a\u0320 \u0334\u030a\u035d\u035b\u031eV\u0338\u0351\u0304\u0308\u030c\u030a\u0347\u035a\u0331I\u0334\u0344\u035d\u0344\u0327\u035a\u0330\u031e\u0327B\u0338\u034a\u030c\u0342\u0343\u0310\u032c\u032a\u0321E\u0335\u030e\u033d\u0344\u0313\u0359\u033c\u0330\u031e\u0339\u0347S\u0337\u035d\u0309\u033e\u034a\u0302\u033e\u0331\u034d\u0356\u033c\u034d\u032f\u0327._ I\u2019d seriously appreciate it if my diabetologist used a model, or a simulation of some kind, got my body\u2019s parameters there somehow, and found the improvements to my schedule _that way_. Maybe she has some expert knowledge in her head but from my perspective it\u2019s all guessworks. Err, I mean v\u0334\u0302\u033ci\u0334\u0307\u0325b\u0338\u030c\u0320e\u0336\u0315\u0359s\u0334\u0341\u0332.\n\nAnd this is where my programmer mind comes in.\n\n* * *\n\nThere are people who take **insulin pumps** (which provide insulin in very small very frequent doses and are ~permanently injected into your body, but are otherwise dumb as a brick) and combine them with **continuous glucose monitors,** and make the glucose measurements inform and control the pump. This is called \u201cclosed loop\u201d or \u201cartificial pancreas\u201d, and getting one officially is very hard or impossible: not FDA approved yet / you need to be part of an university study to get one / \u2026 It\u2019s one of those things that \u201cwill be here in 5 years\u201d, _they say every year for the past 30 years._\n\n> Aside: I try not to be too butthurt about it: CGMs have just recently started being available and even fully sponsored by the Czech health insurance companies, and having a 1440-datapoints-a-day graph is a _MASSIVE_ improvement compared to pricking your finger 4x a day and getting 4 datapoints for your blood glucose graph with nothing in between. So, the artificial pancreas is slowly coming. Unlike nuclear fusion.\n\nThe most prominent of these people hacking their devices together, in my social bubble at least, is [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/)\n, the Microsoft programmer guy. (Check out his [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNhYhlBQoEY)\n.) He\u2019s a T1DM as well and has been promoting the [#WeAreNotWaiting](https://wearenotwaiting.net/)\n initiative where people take their own pump and their own CGM and hack them together despite the healthcare companies\u2019 pleas that it\u2019s not approved and not safe etc. #TheyAreNotWaiting.\n\nAnd that is really inspirational.\n\nI don\u2019t have a pump myself (and to have a chance of getting one I\u2019d first have to find another diabetologist, which makes this into a _\u201ctoo much work, can\u2019t be bothered\u201d_ issue for me), so I can\u2019t currently do quite what they are doing, but I can go with the high-level idea and #NotWait in my own way.\n\n* * *\n\nA few days ago I was fumbling down the stairs to our kitchen at ~3:00 in the morning to fix my hypo. (Night hypoglycemias are _especially_ bad: what if you don\u2019t wake up?) On the stairs I had the thought: why the hell is there no app into which I\u2019d put my past X blood glucose values, my usual daily schedule, my weight, height, gender, age, whatever, and it would let me play with some kind of prediction (interactively!) and find good dosages / meal times / injection times? Then I would have a potentially good target to get to, and over the course of a few days I could gradually adjust my real dosage to that level and see how it behaves, and hopefully stay in the 4-10 mmol/l range much more easily.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t such a thing exist?\n\n(Coincidentally I\u2019ve also started chatting about this and other app ideas with [John Pavlick](https://twitter.com/lambdapriest)\n. Thanks for your encouragement, John!)\n\nSo I started googling. Turns out there are _many_ papers detailing differential equations for a model of how glucose and insulin interact, and how an artificial pancreas could get you to the correct range automatically. The issue is, I DON\u2019T HAVE AN ARTIFICIAL PANCREAS. I have four daily injections. Give me something useful for those!\n\nThere\u2019s not too much to pick from.\n\n> To be honest, I also don\u2019t really know how to translate those differential equations into a simulation algorithm, even if I found a good model. I\u2019m guessing I need to write an [ODE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation)\n>  solver like [Runge-Kutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods)\n>  for the specific set of equations and somehow find _my_ specific parameters for it. It\u2019s been a while since I studied this in uni.\n\nOne of the links led me to [diabetes.zcu.cz](https://diabetes.zcu.cz/)\n though, and in particular their [SmartCGMS](https://diabetes.zcu.cz/smartcgms/)\n app (open-source too!). From the screenshots it seemed kinda relevant, or at least similar to what I had in mind for my dream app.\n\n[![SmartCGMS](https://martin.janiczek.cz/assets/images/2024-07-23-taking-my-diabetes-treatment-into-my-own-hands/smartcgms.png)](/assets/images/2024-07-23-taking-my-diabetes-treatment-into-my-own-hands/smartcgms.png)\n\nSo I sent an email to the authors. Found one maintainer on GitHub and wrote them an email detailing my woes and the app I\u2019d love to write, and whether they could point me to some existing software or good papers on modelling multiple-dose-injection treatment (as opposed to a pump / artificial pancreas).\n\nWhat they gave me was better than I could imagine. (Thanks again, [Martin](https://github.com/MartinUbl)\n!) They had a wrapper for the core SmartCGMS engine (which contains [implementations of some of these models](https://github.com/SmartCGMS/core/blob/dffdd89a274144d0e9ecbe9f581db9eca0e4b8ed/model/src/bergman/bergman.cpp#L82)\n already) for the C# language. The API was quite simple:\n\n*   `.Create(...)` - initialize the simulation\n*   `.Step()` - step one time-unit (typically a minute) in the simulation\n*   `.ScheduleInsulinBasalRate(double unitsPerHour)` - schedule a (pump, sadly) insulin dosage\n*   `.ScheduleInsulinBolus(double units)` - schedule a short-acting insulin injection\n*   `.ScheduleCarbohydratesIntake(double grams)` - schedule food consumption\n*   `.Terminate()` - stop the simulation\n\nAnd then there was the current simulation state:\n\n*   `.BloodGlucose` - current blood sugar, in mmol/l\n*   `.InterstitialGlucose` - glucose in your interstitial fluid - let\u2019s skip it, not important\n*   `.InsulinOnBoard` - how much insulin is still left to be absorbed\n*   `.CarbohydratesOnBoard` - how much sugar is still left to be absorbed\n\nAs you can see, with some caveats this would let me make a simulation for my daily schedule.\n\nSo a few moments later I had something like this (in C# but here presented as Elm)\n\n    type IntakeType\n      = BasalInsulin -- long-acting\n      | BolusInsulin -- short-acting\n      | Carbs        -- fooooooooooooood!\n    \n    type alias Intake =\n      { intakeType : IntakeType\n      , amount : Float\n      , timeMinutes : Int\n      }\n    \n    type alias Input =\n      { basalInsulin : Intake\n      , bolusInsulins : List Intake\n      , carbs : List Intake\n      }\n    \n    type alias OutputRow =\n      { minute : Float\n      , bloodGlucose : Float\n      , carbohydratesOnBoard : Float\n      , insulinOnBoard : Float\n      , interstitialGlucose : Float\n      }\n    \n    simulate : Input -> Int -> List OutputRow\n    simulate input days =\n      ...\n    \n    mySchedule : Input\n    mySchedule =\n      { basalInsulin = Intake BasalInsulin (22 * 60) 32\n      , bolusInsulins =\n          [ Intake BolusInsulin (10 * 60) 18\\\n          , Intake BolusInsulin (13 * 60) 22\\\n          , Intake BolusInsulin (19 * 60) 21\\\n          ]\n      , carbs =\n          [ Intake Carbs (10 * 60) 24\\\n          , Intake Carbs (13 * 60) 60\\\n          , Intake Carbs (19 * 60) 60\\\n          , Intake Carbs (22 * 60) 24\\\n          ]\n      }\n    \n    myPrediction : List OutputRow\n    myPrediction =\n      simulate mySchedule 3\n    \n\nNever have I copied the resulting CSV into Google Sheets so fast. Tada:\n\n[![I'm the artist now.](https://martin.janiczek.cz/assets/images/2024-07-23-taking-my-diabetes-treatment-into-my-own-hands/00-accidental-art.png)](/assets/images/2024-07-23-taking-my-diabetes-treatment-into-my-own-hands/00-accidental-art.png)\n\nOh, wait, that\u2019s not it. Cool piece of accidental art though! Now let me use the correct column for the X axis.\n\n[![Google Sheets](https://martin.janiczek.cz/assets/images/2024-07-23-taking-my-diabetes-treatment-into-my-own-hands/01-google-sheets.png)](/assets/images/2024-07-23-taking-my-diabetes-treatment-into-my-own-hands/01-google-sheets.png)\n\nWell hot damn. The graph actually makes sense!\n\nGranted, it\u2019s not _me_ in the graph but I can simulate _someone_ now!\n\n_Let\u2019s stash away \u201cI need to actually simulate_ me, _you know\u201d as a TODO for future Martin and continue._\n\n* * *\n\nNext I made a Windows Forms application with an OxyPlot chart so that I don\u2019t need to write a CSV to a file and manually copy it to Google Sheets.\n\n> Aside: what do you .NET folks use nowadays? MAUI? WPF? Xamarin Forms? It\u2019s kinda confusing for an outsider.\n\nThis took me a while to figure out (I\u2019m not a C# guy; honestly I\u2019ve thought about rewriting this into F# instead the moment I had to start learning about event handlers and delegates), but I succeeded:\n\n[![Initial graph](https://martin.janiczek.cz/assets/images/2024-07-23-taking-my-diabetes-treatment-into-my-own-hands/02-initial-graph.png)](/assets/images/2024-07-23-taking-my-diabetes-treatment-into-my-own-hands/02-initial-graph.png)\n\nThere\u2019s one little issue with seeing just the first day of the simulation though, and that\u2019s the fact that I inject my basal (long-acting) insulin at 22:00. So for the majority of the first day the glucose will just be higher because I haven\u2019t injected the long-acting insulin yet. So let\u2019s simulate more days just to see what happens.\n\n[![Ranges](https://martin.janiczek.cz/assets/images/2024-07-23-taking-my-diabetes-treatment-into-my-own-hands/03-ranges.png)](/assets/images/2024-07-23-taking-my-diabetes-treatment-into-my-own-hands/03-ranges.png)\n\nOh wow, it gets periodic by day 3! Cool!\n\nAs you can see I\u2019ve also added the hypo- and hyperglycemic ranges so that it\u2019s clearer where the \u201cGoldilocks zone\u201d lies. As it turns out, my insulin dosage is absolutely inappropriate for the person simulated by SmartCGMS right now. Hitting such severe hypoglycemia, they\u2019d probably be dead by now (or their liver has to work overtime on dosing that emergency glucose).\n\nOK, well then, now it\u2019s just a small step from simulating a hardcoded\n\n    mySchedule : Input\n    mySchedule =\n      { basalInsulin = Intake BasalInsulin (22 * 60) 32\n      , bolusInsulins =\n          [ Intake BolusInsulin (10 * 60) 18\\\n          , Intake BolusInsulin (13 * 60) 22\\\n          , Intake BolusInsulin (19 * 60) 21\\\n          ]\n      , carbs =\n          [ Intake Carbs (10 * 60) 24\\\n          , Intake Carbs (13 * 60) 60\\\n          , Intake Carbs (19 * 60) 60\\\n          , Intake Carbs (22 * 60) 24\\\n          ]\n      }\n    \n\nto automatically finding a more optimal dosage!\n\n* * *\n\nI\u2019ve opened the NuGet package manager, wrote `genetic` and installed the most popular package: [GeneticSharp](https://github.com/giacomelli/GeneticSharp)\n. Turns out it\u2019s _really solid._ It needed me to provide the usual stuff: chromosomes, crossover, selection, population size, termination criteria\u2026 and the fitness function.\n\nThe fitness function actually deserves a fuller description. It looks like this:\n\n    fitness : Input -> Float\n    fitness input =\n      let\n        output : List OutputRow\n        output = simulate input 3\n    \n        longtermHypos = output |> List.takeLast (24*60) |> List.count (\\row -> row.bloodGlucose < 4)\n        longtermHypers = output |> List.takeLast (24*60) |> List.count (\\row -> row.bloodGlucose >= 10)\n        ...\n    \n        longtermHyposNormalized = longtermHypos / List.length output\n        longtermHypersNormalized = longtermHypers / List.length output\n        ...\n    \n        longtermHyposWeight = 15\n        longtermHypersWeight = 12\n        ...\n    \n        weightSum = longtermHyposWeight + longtermHypersWeight + ...\n      in\n      ( longtermHyposNormalized * longtermHyposWeight\n      + longtermHypersNormalized * longtermHypersWeight\n      + ...\n      ) / weightSum\n    \n\n_(Yes I know stuff is computed needlessly here; in the real C# code I\u2019m doing all the intermediate result reuse you wish I did here, but I\u2019m optimizing for understanding instead here.)_\n\nTurns out I care about many things. The following list evolved gradually but I\u2019m only giving you the final version:\n\n*   minimize # of hypoglycemic readings in the (stabilized) last day\n*   minimize # of hyperglycemic readings in the last day\n*   as small amplitude between min and max glucose reading as possible in the last day\n*   minimize the sum of bolus insulin dosages\n*   minimize the basal insulin dosage\n*   minimize # of hypoglycemic readings in the stabilization phase (first 2 days)\n*   minimize # of hyperglycemic readings in the stabilization phase\n\nNote that I don\u2019t care about all of those equally. I\u2019ve actually sorted the above list by priority: long-term hypos are the most urgent, the temporary hypers while the system settles I care about the least. I\u2019m encoding that via the weights. Each of the normalized measurements is a number `0..1`, which then gets multiplied by the weight.\n\nI\u2019m not quite sure whether this is the right way to encode multiple concerns into a single number, but it\u2019s the best I could come up with without consulting math books, and it seems to work well. At least I couldn\u2019t find a case where an input with lower (better) fitness was less preferable to me (according to my brain\u2019s fuzzy intuition) than another input with higher (worse) fitness.\n\nIf I was able to construct all the values and sort them, I\u2019d probably do something like\n\n    allCombinations\n      |> List.sortBy (\\output ->\n           [ longtermHypos output\\\n           , longtermHypers output\\\n           , amplitude output\\\n           , ...\\\n           ]\n         )\n    \n\n(that is, I can order outputs pairwise), but that\u2019s not how the genetic programming libraries work. I believe explicitly not going through the whole space is one of their very top priorities :)\n\n> Aside: how many inputs are there? This to me looks like permutations with repetitions (order does matter), `n^r` , so in my case `injectionPossibilities ^ injectionCount`, and for my specific example schedule, `51^4` (assuming I can inject `0..50` units of insulin). That\u2019s around 6.7 million.\n\nSo this could be bruteforceable. But I have to run the whole simulation inside the fitness function, and it takes around a second or two.\n\nAt least it\u2019s parallelizable then! (And believe me, I\u2019m making use of my 16 cores.)\n\nGiven it\u2019s a pure function (basically\u2026 the results vary around the 10th decimal digit - negligible), I can memoize the fitness function for the input of four ints. The genetic algorithm ends up repeating some guesses quite a lot near the end of the simulation, so this actually saves a lot of time.\n\nWriting a memoization function in C# was a breath of fresh air, coming from the pure FP world of Elm:\n\n    private Dictionary<List<Intake>, double> fitnessCache = new(new IntakesSameAmount());\n    \n    // ...\n    \n    if (fitnessCache.TryGetValue(amounts, out var cachedFitness))\n        return cachedFitness;\n    \n    // ...\n    \n    var fitness = Fitness(newInput);\n    fitnessCache.Add(amounts, fitness);\n    return fitness;\n    \n\n_Amazing what you can do with a bit of mutation. Yeah I\u2019ll go return my Elm badge now._\n\n* * *\n\nSo, with this fitness function created, I can now run the genetic algorithm. Let\u2019s add a button and some more info to the UI, and start it off!\n\n[![Intakes on the side, and a button](https://martin.janiczek.cz/assets/images/2024-07-23-taking-my-diabetes-treatment-into-my-own-hands/04-original-and-best.png)](/assets/images/2024-07-23-taking-my-diabetes-treatment-into-my-own-hands/04-original-and-best.png)\n\n_WELL HOT DAMN._ It has optimized the insulin intakes and the patient (again, sadly not _me_) is now stable inside the 4-10 mmol/l range.\n\nThat\u2019s really magical. I feel like I\u2019ve solved diabetes. Of course it\u2019s not as simple. There will always be unexpected things and changes you need to react to. You\u2019ll have hypers, you\u2019ll have hypos and it\u2019s OK. But still. It managed to squeeze the blood glucose into the correct range.\n\n* * *\n\nSo, what do I need to make this useful _to me?_\n\nI feel like interactivity would go a long way. Being able to add injections or meals, move them up and down, left and right, and seeing the graph change based on that, would give the diabetic much better understanding than the _\u201cOK I\u2019m gonna inject more before lunch today and see what happens two hours from now\u201d_ feedback loop, or even worse, the _\u201cconsult a doctor every three months\u201d_ one. Did I mention I\u2019m a big fan of short feedback loops?\n\nOf course, it needs to simulate _me_ instead of somebody else. I can\u2019t use these optimized dosages because my body reacts differently. I need to consult this with the SmartCGMS folks, but the process will likely involve me downloading my historical blood glucose data off my Freestyle Libre sensor and somebody somewhere fitting the model parameters to that data. The math escapes me but it can be done.\n\nAnother issue is that the algorithm is optimized for pumps, and my basal (long-acting) insulin will need to be tracked into the model a bit differently. Right now it\u2019s as if I was injecting 1/24-th of the dosage every hour, instead of the full dosage once a day. But once the specific insulin brand and its behaviour is tracked in the software, I will be able to call `.ScheduleInsulinBasal(double units)` and all should be well (and more precise), hopefully.\n\nSo, there\u2019s a bunch of stuff yet to be done and collaborate with the SmartCGMS folks on, but I\u2019m _really_ excited by this, and feel empowered taking care of my diabetes better than I thought I could. WE\u2019VE GOT THE TECHNOLOGY! Genetic algorithms and Markov Chains, baby!\n\n* * *\n\nWhat\u2019s that? I didn\u2019t mention Markov Chains _once_ in the article?\n\nOh yeah, well, I experimented with a bunch of stuff. To end off the blogpost, here\u2019s a stupid random walk arriving at a value iteratively. (Change each intake by a random value `-2..+2`, and if the fitness of that tweaked input is better, keep the change, otherwise rollback.)\n\n* * *\n\n[<\\\n\\\nPrevious Post\\\n\\\nNotes from Elm Camp 2024](/2024/06/22/notes-from-elm-camp-2024.html \"Notes from Elm Camp 2024\")\n\n[](/2024/07/23/taking-my-diabetes-treatment-into-my-own-hands.html)\n\n-----\nGenerate comments in a hierarchical structure with 3 comments per level, up to a depth of 3."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n- **jklinger410** (): What I&#x27;ve learned that, as an adult in 2024 in the United States, you cannot take for granted:<p>- That your medical professionals are acting in your best interest<p>- That your insurance company is acting in your best interest<p>- That your medical professional knows what they are talking about<p>- That things that are legal to put in your body will not cause irreparable harm to you<p>- That the legal level of pollutants in the water, air, ground, walls, floors, etc are actually safe or even being measured properly<p>- That you aren&#x27;t being subjected to something that later will be found to be unhealthy, even if it is currently known, until it is litigated in retrospect<p>- That you can afford the treatment that would be necessary to make yourself healthy<p>- That anyone in the industries that would normally protect you (healthcare, insurance, public health, government, etc) even care to do so<p>I understand that some people would look at that list and say I should have never expected some of those, but pardon me for being propagandized at a very young age that we lived in a country that was good and just.

It&#x27;s very rare to find a professional who is diabetic, even though they eat one big carb-heavy meal a day and are morbidly obese. IIRC, this is explained by their low visceral fat levels, which are driven by high adiponectin levels that are themselves driven by their intense workouts and consistent sleep habits. Their high subcutaneous fat proportion is actually thought to be protective. T2D catches up to them after they retire and stop exercising and sleeping well.<p>Their experience touches on 3 factors:<p>&gt;Exercise volume (which, according to newer research, should be spread out over the course of the day)<p>&gt;Diet (which should be focused not just on maintaining steady, low blood sugar levels, but on dietary factors that encourage subcutaneous rather than visceral fat deposition)<p>&gt;Sleep quality<p>The last, I think, is extremely undervalued. My father developed T2 in his 30s, and it progressed consistently until he was diagnosed with sleep apnea and received treatment.

This certificate was required for Facebook to decrypt TLS traffic.\n*   Some versions of the older app contain the Facebook Research CA certs as embedded assets in the distributed app from 2016. One cert is valid until 2027. Data discovery content in court documents state certificates are \"generated on the server and sent to the device\".\n*   Soon after the \"ssl bump\" feature was deployed in the Protect app, a newer version of Android was released that included improved security controls that would render this method unusable on devices with the newer operating system.\n*   A review of an old Snapchat app shows that it's analytics domain did not employ certificate pinning, meaning that MITM / \"ssl bumping\" would have worked as described.\n*   In addition to the core functionality of gathering other app's usage statistics through abusing a permission granted by the user, there also appears to be other functionality to obtain questionable sensitive data, such as the [subscriber IMSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_mobile_subscriber_identity?ref=doubleagent.net)\n    .\n\nThe setup most likely would have looked something the following diagram:\n\n![](https://doubleagent.net/content/images/2024/04/fb1-3-1.png)\n\nAn interpretation of FB's setup based on court documents and app analysis\n\nHere we have a trusted cert installed on the device, all device traffic going over a VPN to Facebook controlled infrastructure, traffic redirected into a Squid caching proxy setup as a transparent proxy with the 'ssl bump' feature configured. We know from the documents that various domains belonging to Snapchat, Amazon and Youtube were of interest. It's not known if any other user traffic was intercepted, or just proxied on. This type of information we can't obtain from looking at the archived Onavo Protect apps, rather for the time being, we have to rely on the content in the court documents made available to the public.\n\nOver time the success of their strategy to employ a transparent TLS proxy was diminishing due to improved security controls in Android. Additionally certificate pinning adoption was said to be an issue. As an alterative, Facebook were considering using the [Accessibility API](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10964491?hl=en&ref=doubleagent.net#:~:text=Google%20Play%20permits%20the%20use,that%20they%20are%20accessibility%20tools.)\n as an alternative.\n\n![](https://doubleagent.net/content/images/2024/04/image-14.png)\n\nPage 3 - Case 3:20-cv-08570-JD Document 736\n\nThis is what Google has to say about using the accessibility features on their operating system:\n\n> \"only services that are designed to help people with disabilities access their device or otherwise overcome challenges stemming from their disabilities are eligible to declare that they are accessibility tools.\"\n\nIt's somewhat telling of a company that would consider abusing features designed to support people with disabilities for a competitive advantage. Generally, Android accessibility functionality misuse is attributed to malicious applications such as [banking malware](https://blog.pradeo.com/accessibility-services-mobile-analysis-malware?ref=doubleagent.net)\n.\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nMark Zuckerberg states the need for \"_reliable analytics_\" on Snapchat:\n\n![](https://doubleagent.net/content/images/2024/04/image-4.png)\n\nThe solution? \"_Kits that can be installed on iOS and Android that intercept traffic for specific sub-domains_\":\n\n![](https://doubleagent.net/content/images/2024/04/image-6.png)\n\nMy take on the above is that in addition to utilizing the Onavo Protect VPN app to intercept traffic for specific domains, there was an intention to rebrand the core technology and having it distributed in other applications. Facebook had [acquired](https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/13/facebook-buys-mobile-analytics-company-onavo-and-finally-gets-its-office-in-israel/?ref=doubleagent.net)\n Onavo for approximately $120M USD in 2013 and needed to put this technology in good use. That price point should give a clear indication on the value they placed on the ability to gain competitor intelligence from people's phones and tablets.\n\n[Prior research](https://medium.com/@chronic_9612/notes-on-analytics-and-tracking-in-onavo-protect-for-ios-904bdff346c0?ref=doubleagent.net)\n on the iOS version notes that the Onavo VPN app was collecting some usage telemetry from iPhones. On Android we can see the app was pulling much more fine grained statistics from their user's devices by utilizing permissions granted under the pretext of showing the user app data usage (we will see how this looked in an embedded video below). But that was not enough, Facebook wanted to take this one step further and intercept encrypted traffic towards specific competitor's analytics domains in order to obtain data on the \"**in-app actions\"**.\n\nAll they would need to do is to get the user to install a custom certificate into the user's phone's trust store (and be on specific Android releases).\n\n\ud83d\udca1\n\nThe wiretapping information is new and perhaps not to be confused with what occured prior:  \n  \nIn 2023, two subsidiaries of Facebook was ordered to pay a total of $20M by the Australian Federal Court for \"engaging in conduct liable to mislead in breach of the Australian Consumer Law\", according to the [ACCC](https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/20m-penalty-for-meta-companies-for-conduct-liable-to-mislead-consumers-about-use-of-their-data?ref=doubleagent.net)\n.  \n  \nFacebook had shutdown Onavo in 2019 after an [investigation](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/?ref=doubleagent.net)\n revealed they had been paying teenagers to use the app to track them. Also that year, Apple went as far as to [revoke Facebook's developer program certificates](https://web.archive.org/web/20220609072355/https://www.vox.com/2019/1/30/18203231/apple-banning-facebook-research-app)\n, sending a clear message.  \n  \nDespite the apps being taken offline, we are able to find old archived versions which enabled the technical insights offered in this post.\n\nTechnical analysis\n------------------\n\nWebsites and applications on end user devices trust remote websites or servers over HTTPS/TLS due to public certificates that are stored in the device's trust store. These \"certificate authority\" certs are the \"trust anchor\" that applications rely on to verify they communicating with the intended party. These certificates are generally distributed and stored within the operating system. By adding your own self-signed certificate to the appropriate trust store, it is often possible to intercept encrypted TLS traffic. Corporations may also do this as a means of inspecting outbound traffic from employee's devices. Security testers may also do this on their own devices. There are legitimate reasons for doing this. The question here is if what Facebook did was legitimate, meaning, was it legal or not.\n\nThere is some irony that the documentation for software that Facebook is said to employ to do the interception contains the following [warning](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslBump?ref=doubleagent.net)\n:\n\n> HTTPS was designed to give users an expectation of privacy and security. Decrypting HTTPS tunnels without user consent or knowledge may violate ethical norms and may be illegal in your jurisdiction.\n\nUnlike iOS on the iPhone, Google has made numerous changes to make it extremely difficult to install a CA cert that will be trusted by most applications on the phone. In Android 11, released in September 2020, Google had completely blocked the mechanism which the app used to prompt a user to install the cert and no application would trust any certificate in the user store by default.\n\n\ud83d\udca1\n\nPeople have asked \"__what about cert pinning? wouldn't this have prevented successful MITM of the traffic?__\"  \n  \nWhile that would be the case, as we will see later, at the time, the Snapchat app did not implement cert pinning for it's analytics domain. This would likely hold true for the other app domains. So it appears Facebook had leveraged off this technical limitation / oversight by it's competitors.\n\nSo today, technically speaking, is is simply is not possible to do what Facebook had done back in 2016 to 2019. But it worked - so how did they do it? Fortunately, at least with Android and the Play store ecosystem, we are able to often go back in time and sometimes dig up old Android app packages.\n\nThe first thing is to install the Onavo app on a test handset to see how users would interact with the app. Despite the VPN connectivity not working and the actual backend service being down, we do get a glimpse on how the application coerces the user into accepting multiple permissions:\n\n0:00\n\n/0:45\n\n 1\u00d7 \n\nWhat we see here under pretext of providing the user 'protection', two particular permissions are of concern:\n\n*   Display over other apps\n*   Access past and deleted app usage\n\n> \"_We need this permission to show you how much mobile data your apps use._\"\n\nWhat they didn't explain is that this feature is not so much for the benefit of the user who installed the app, but actually Onavo/Facebook. And this type of information is valuable, to the tune of $120M (what FB paid in the acquisition).\n\n![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJpCkIEbkAAsckm?format=jpg&name=small)\n\nThe Android manifest includes the `uses-permission` directive `android.permission.PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS` which is what we are agreeing to in the screenshot above:\n\n![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJptvfla8AA0rVZ?format=png&name=medium)\n\nContinuing with the \"application stats\" feature (assumed to be the original core functionality), we can dump the schema of the local database on the handset to get an idea on exactly what it was collecting on the device itself:\n\n![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJpyTakbIAAeD_A?format=png&name=large)\n\nMostly it seems they could just obtain statistics on in app usage of other applications and of course the network traffic usage for the apps. It's still somewhat high level statistics and clearly not enough granularity for what Mark was after, implied by one of the emails in the court documents. Intercepting the actual encrypted traffic towards the analytics domains of various competitors on the other hand, would do the trick. And to do this, Facebook would have to get a CA certificate somehow on the device.\n\nBut we don't see any prompt to install any certificate. This is because the VPN did not successfully connect to the remote service, which appears to be precondition. Time or interest permitting, I may go back to figure out how to trigger the certificate installation prompt.\n\n![](https://doubleagent.net/content/images/2024/04/GJo--s8aQAAYwtL.png)\n\nConnections timing out, and a tcpdump shows that all traffic from the device is dropped after the VPN connection is initiated\n\n### Onto the CA certificates\n\nDecompiling the app, we do see the functionality is there. In the following image, the method highlighted calls `KeyChain.createInstallIntent()` to install a certificate. Here a popup would appear asking the user for permission, with the name \"Facebook Research\"\n\n![](https://doubleagent.net/content/images/2024/04/GJpP7rmaAAAQDKI.png)\n\n`KeyChain.createInstallIntent()` [stopped working](https://commonsware.com/R/pages/chap-security-004.html?ref=doubleagent.net)\n in Android 7 (Nougat). A user would have to manually install the certificate. It would no longer be possible to have Facebook's CA cert installed directly in the app.\n\nAnother notable change in Android 7 - According to the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/security-config?ref=doubleagent.net)\n (emphasis mine):\n\n> By default, secure connections (using protocols like TLS and HTTPS) from all apps trust the pre-installed system CAs, and **apps targeting Android 6.0 (API level 23) and lower also trust the user-added CA store by default**\n\nIn other words, it appears other apps would have trusted certs in the user store from Android Marshmallow (Android 6) and below, but from Android 7, released in August 22, 2016, they would no longer be trusted at all by other applications, unless due to a security configuration in the app's manifest file.\n\nAnother improvement to Android in version 7 was that it was made impossible to install certificates into the system store by _any_ means except by fully rooting the device.\n\nRegardless, the functionality remained in both the older version and newer, all the way to the last published app in 2019. The actual MITM certificate was removed in 2017. Detail in the court documents may offer plausible explanation:\n\n> Where is the key generated that's used for the SSL bump and how it protected from abuse? (e.g., is generated on the device, specific to that device, and never leaves the device, or is there a shared key that's downloaded with the app and installed)  \n>   \n> **The certificate is generated on the server and being sent to the device**\n\n![](https://doubleagent.net/content/images/2024/04/image-15.png)\n\nPage 3 - Case 3:20-cv-08570-JD Document 736\n\nSo we need to go back to much older releases before 2019, specifically a version from September 2017. The certificates in this version are found as assets named \"`old_ca.cer`\" and \"`new_ca.cer`\". The relevant code is found in the class `ResearchCertificateManager`.\n\n![](https://doubleagent.net/content/images/2024/04/image-7.png)\n\nThe can be found under the \"assets\" folder (if uncompressing the .apk as a zip file). Observed in JADX:\n\n![](https://doubleagent.net/content/images/2024/04/image-9.png)\n\nAlso observing the routine to check if the certificates have been installed or not:\n\n![](https://doubleagent.net/content/images/2024/04/image-8.png)\n\nNow why would there be two certificates? (old and new)? Here are the two certificates pulled from one version of the app. Whoever had created the first certificate had only issued it to be valid for one year. If this was an oversight, they did manage to figure it out before the expiry time.\n\n![](https://doubleagent.net/content/images/2024/04/GJq8BYsbUAAiREe.png)\n\n![](https://doubleagent.net/content/images/2024/04/GJq8JjeaAAA59Ec.png)\n\nold\\_va.cer vs new\\_ca.cer\n\nI have not been able to find all versions of the .apk online, but enough to draw the following conclusion:\n\n*   The first certificate was valid from Sep 8th 2016, some months before Mark Zuckerberg put the call out to gain further insight into Snapchat (email dated June 9th, 2016)\n*   The second certificate was added alongside the first which was valid from Jun 8th, 2017. It will be valid until Jun 8 2027.\n*   At least from Oct 19th, 2027, there are no certs, the second cert was deleted from the app completely. As stated earlier, court documents explain certificates were obtained from the server. I have yet to locate the functionality relevant to this in the apps I have obtained from [archives](https://apkpure.com/onavo-protect-from-facebook/com.onavo.spaceship?ref=doubleagent.net)\n    , and more work needs to be done here.\n\nVersions with certificates found with their respective fingerprints:\n\n![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJrEPLeaEAAhjQM?format=png&name=900x900)\n\nThe court documents state that there was additional interception of YouTube and Amazon at later dates. Here we would have to dig further to find out in which apps and how this was done:\n\n![](https://doubleagent.net/content/images/2024/04/image-12.png)\n\nPage 2, case 3:20-cv-08570-JD Document 735\n\n### Back to the pinning question\n\nAny app doing full certificate pinning would have prevented this technique from working. Around the time period in question, Snapchat was doing some certificate pinning. But not everywhere.\n\nWe can go back and grab an old Snapchat app and check for ourselves. What was the domain? According to one the artefacts in the document discovery, it was `sc-analytics.appspot.com`:\n\n![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GKBeIsTbgAAdHpH?format=png&name=small)\n\nAnd behold, in a decompilation of and old Snapchat app, traffic to this domain did not use certificate pinning:\n\n![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GKBnQNdb0AA2M8t?format=png&name=medium)\n\nAs discussed earlier, Facebook were aware of the security enhancements in Android and the wider adoption of pinning, with the statement included (reference earlier):\n\n> There is a general question on SSL bump long term applicability on Android as SSL pinning by default is present on newer devices.\n\nWhat else?\n----------\n\nThis one caught my eye, a request to obtain the [subscriber IMSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_mobile_subscriber_identity?ref=doubleagent.net)\n. A very sensitive bit of data indeed:\n\n![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJp7AoJaQAA5E-N?format=png&name=medium)\n\nInitially I was wondering how this is even possible, and it seems at the time, it was actually possible with the permission `READ_PHONE_STATE`:\n\n![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJqOvKmbwAAmL_p?format=png&name=medium)\n\nWhich of course was defined in the app's manifest:\n\n![](https://doubleagent.net/content/images/2024/04/image-10.png)\n\nGiven this discovery, there is probably more to explore.\n\nWrapping up\n-----------\n\nWhile this is all \"old news\" in the sense that happened years ago, it is interesting from a technical standpoint to see how far application developers, and even companies like Facebook will go to abuse permission models on mobile phones.\n\nAnd there is certainly is more to dig into, such as the routine to trigger the CA install procedure, how certs were added after 2017 and what else the Onavo application was collecting. Also, it would also be nice to find iPhone version of the application if anyone knows where to find copies.\n\nIf the class action lawsuit progresses in an interesting way, perhaps this could provide further motivation to continue the exploration.\n\nIf you are interested in receiving further updates, feel free to subscribe below with an email address, and/or follow me on [X](https://twitter.com/haxrob?ref=doubleagent.net)\n.\n\nSign up for doubleagent.net\n---------------------------\n\nA telco and IoT focused security blog\n\n Subscribe\n\nEmail sent!

With the new MITM information revealed: what is currently unclear is if all app users had their traffic &quot;intercepted&quot; or just a subset of users.\n- **dylan604** (): The email snippets are impressive on multiple levels, mainly how fucking stupid&#x2F;arrogant people at FB must be. Openly talking about MITM, and then getting multiple other companies to include this kit in their products as well is just beyond stupid for putting in writing. &quot;Hey Zuck, I have an idea on your proposal. We should get together to discuss in person&quot; would be suspect, but at least it&#x27;s not incriminating. It&#x27;s like these people have never seen a movie, or read a news article on other companies getting caught.\n  - **xmprt** (): A piece of advice I&#x27;ve taken to heart is whenever I&#x27;m sending something in writing, to think about how I would feel if I needed to repeat the same things in court or if I found those messages in the news. Not that I&#x27;ve ever said anything near that egregious but it still helps.\n    - **ben0x539** (): Whenever I&#x27;m discussing something in person I think about how I would feel if it turned out my employer was breaking the law and me not putting it in writing stopped the injured parties from obtaining just compensation.\n    - **Kye** (): &quot;Dance like no one is watching; email like it may one day be read aloud in a deposition.&quot; - Olivia Nuzzi<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20141214193908&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Olivianuzzi&#x2F;status&#x2F;543877654576107520\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20141214193908&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.c...</a>\n    - **GeoAtreides** (): When putting down something in writing, you should also remember cardinal Richelieu&#x27;s quote: &quot;If you give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest of men, I will find something in them which will hang him.&quot;\n  - **cen4** (): Billionaire bosses are all surrounded by opportunists and flatterers. Over time like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch the size of this group grows to unmanageable dimensions, cause anyone acting moderately sane will be treated as an existential threat to their lives of fantasy, domination, manipulation, luxury, leisure etc and pushed out.\n    - **Terr_** (): &gt; acting moderately sane will be treated as an existential threat [...] and pushed out.<p>Or converted, by making them take actions so that &quot;if we go down you&#x27;re going down with us.&quot;<p>Organized crime works that way too, come to think of it.

It&#x27;s a tragedy that working for Meta is generally seen as neutral whereas working at any defense-related companies is often met with scorn, despite the overwhelmingly greater negative impact that working at the former has.<p>And this doesn&#x27;t even touch upon Instagram.<p>I guess that they pay too much and employ too much of our industry, greatly reducing criticism because we all have a friend who has worked at Meta or we may even have applied ourselves at some point. Whereas we don&#x27;t know anyone who has been at e.g. Anduril at the likes.\n    - **dagmx** (): I have several extremely talented friends at Meta, and the one constant is they left any attachment to the output product when they entered the workplace. Whereas they previously (at other top tech companies) did take pride in their employees output. Meta is \u201csuccess at all costs\u201d and heavily metrics driven.<p>I think that\u2019s what contributes to things like Myanmar and other countries hate speech proliferation. When you don\u2019t care about how your product is used, and can focus on just the technical aspect, you lose any sense of responsibility.<p>Conversely, we\u2019ve hired many ex meta people, and they\u2019ve always almost all unanimously said how much they NOW like having pride in the products they create, after jumping ship.<p>Imho it\u2019s an issue of top down culture from Zuckerberg, and previously Thiel.\n- **afavour** (): Not to downplay it but at least this requires users to download the Onavo app, which isn\u2019t so common.<p>The one that I wonder about a lot is this: there are two (non-deprecated) types of webview you can use in iOS: WKWebview and SFSafariViewController. They\u2019re intended for very different uses.<p>When you tap on a link in the Facebook app they <i>should</i> use SFSafariViewController. It\u2019s private (app code has no visibility into it), it shares cookies with Safari, it\u2019s literally intended for \u201cload some external web content within the context of this app\u201d<p>Instead, FB still uses WKWebView. With that you can inject arbitrary JS into any page you want. Track navigations, resources loaded, the works. Given the revelations we\u2019ve seen in this article and many others I shudder to imagine what FB is doing with those capabilities. They\u2019re probably tracking user behavior on external sites down to every tap on every pixel. It seems insane to think they might be tracking every username and password entered in their in-app webviews but they have the technical capability to. And do we really trust that they wouldn\u2019t?\n  - **fastest963** (): They definitely inject JS as we had a problem with them breaking certain JS calls with payment autofill before [1].<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;jameshartig&#x2F;status&#x2F;1534886418266431488\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;jameshartig&#x2F;status&#x2F;1534886418266431488</a>\n  - **windmark** (): I wasn\u2019t aware that WKWebView granted the app such power. Is there a way for me as a user to figure out if WKWebView or SFSafariViewController is being used if I have a web page open? Although I don\u2019t use FB, I do use the web view of other apps and don\u2019t want them to be able to do this either.\n    - **can16358p** (): SFSafariViewController is less customizable visually so the standard &quot;sheet coming up within the app&quot; that looks always the same regardless of the app (at least in most apps and of course not Meta&#x27;s apps) is that one.<p>Having said that, since WKWebView is just a view that can be customized visually, nothing can stop someone to create a WKWebView-wrapping view controller that looks exactly like the &quot;safe&quot; Safari one anyway.\n    - **krausefx** (): Yes, there are ways to distinguish between them as a user, for example you can check to see if your browser plugins are available. I also went through some of the most popular iOS apps and created a list of which app uses the correct SFSafariViewController vs the potentially malicious WKWebView.<p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;krausefx.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;ios-privacy-instagram-and-facebook-can-track-anything-you-do-on-any-website-in-their-in-app-browser\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;krausefx.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;ios-privacy-instagram-and-facebook...</a>\n- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;krausefx.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;announcing-inappbrowsercom-see-what-javascript-commands-get-executed-in-an-in-app-browser\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;krausefx.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;announcing-inappbrowsercom-see-wha...</a>\n  - **haxrob** (): &gt; Not to downplay it but at least this requires users to download the Onavo app, which isn\u2019t so common.<p>10 million installs on Android, according to AndroidRank[1].

A version of this post was originally presented at a company all-hands._\n\nWe don\u2019t talk a lot in public about the big vision for Tailscale, why we\u2019re really here. Usually I prefer to focus on what exists right now, and what we\u2019re going to do in the next few months. The future can be distracting.\n\nBut increasingly, I\u2019ve found companies are starting to buy Tailscale not just for what it does now, but for the big things they expect it\u2019ll do in the future. They\u2019re right! Let\u2019s look at the biggest of big pictures for a change.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s go back to where we started.\n\n#### Old[](#old)\n\nDavid Crawshaw\u2019s first post that laid out what we were doing, long long ago in the late twenty-teens, was called [Remembering the LAN](https://tailscale.com/blog/remembering-the-lan)\n, about his experience doing networking back in the 1990s.\n\nI have bad news: if you remember doing LANs back in the 1990s, you are probably old. Quite a few of us here at Tailscale remember doing LANs in the 1990s. That\u2019s an age gap compared to a lot of other startups. That age gap makes Tailscale unusual.\n\nAnything unusual about a startup can be an advantage or a disadvantage, depending what you do with it.\n\n#### Mature[](#mature)\n\nHere\u2019s another word for \u201cold\u201d but with different connotations.\n\nI\u2019m a person that likes looking on the bright side. There are disadvantages to being old, like I maybe can\u2019t do a 40-hour coding binge like I used to when I wrote my first VPN, called Tunnel Vision, in 1997. But there are advantages, like maybe we have enough experience to do things right the first time, in fewer hours. Sometimes. If we\u2019re lucky.\n\nAnd maybe, you know, if you\u2019re old enough, you\u2019ve seen the tech cycle go round a few times and you\u2019re starting to see a few patterns.\n\nThat was us, me and the Davids, when we started Tailscale. What we saw was, a lot of things have gotten better since the 1990s. Computers are literally millions of times faster. 100x as many people can be programmers now because they aren\u2019t stuck with just C++ and assembly language, and many, many, many more people now have some kind of computer. Plus app stores, payment systems, graphics. All good stuff.\n\nBut, also things have gotten worse. A lot of day-to-day things that used to be easy for developers, are now hard. That was unexpected. I didn\u2019t expect that. I expected I\u2019d be out of a job by now because programming would be so easy.\n\nInstead, the tech industry has evolved into an absolute mess. And it\u2019s getting worse instead of better! Our tower of complexity is now so tall that we seriously consider slathering LLMs on top to write the incomprehensible code in the incomprehensible frameworks so we don\u2019t have to.\n\nAnd you know, we old people are the ones who have the context to see that.\n\nIt\u2019s all fixable. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.\n\nBefore I can tell you a vision for the future I have to tell you what I think went wrong.\n\n#### Not scaling[](#not-scaling)\n\nProgrammers today are impatient for success. They start planning for a billion users before they write their first line of code. In fact, nowadays, we train them to do this without even knowing they\u2019re doing it. Everything they\u2019ve ever been taught revolves around scaling.\n\nWe\u2019ve been falling into this trap all the way back to when computer scientists started teaching big-O notation. In big-O notation, if you use it wrong, a hash table is supposedly faster than an array, for virtually anything you want to do. But in reality, that\u2019s not always true. When you have a billion entries, maybe a hash table is faster. But when you have 10 entries, it almost never is.\n\nPeople have a hard time with this idea. They keep picking the algorithms and architectures that can scale up, even when if you don\u2019t scale up, a different thing would be thousands of times faster, and also easier to build and run.\n\nEven I can barely believe I just said thousands of times easier and I wasn\u2019t exaggerating.\n\nI read a post recently where someone bragged about using kubernetes to scale all the way up to 500,000 page views per month. But that\u2019s 0.2 requests per second. I could serve that from my phone, on battery power, and it would spend most of its time asleep.\n\nIn modern computing, we tolerate long builds, and then docker builds, and uploading to container stores, and multi-minute deploy times before the program runs, and even longer times before the log output gets uploaded to somewhere you can see it, all because we\u2019ve been tricked into this idea that everything has to scale. People get excited about deploying to the latest upstart container hosting service because it only takes tens of seconds to roll out, instead of minutes. But on my slow computer in the 1990s, I could run a perl or python program that started in milliseconds and served way more than 0.2 requests per second, and printed logs to stderr right away so I could edit-run-debug over and over again, multiple times per minute.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nWe got here because sometimes, someone really does need to write a program that has to scale to thousands or millions of backends, so it needs all that\u2026 stuff. And wishful thinking makes people imagine even the lowliest dashboard could be that popular one day.\n\nThe truth is, most things don\u2019t scale, and never need to. We made Tailscale for those things, so you can spend your time scaling the things that really need it. The long tail of jobs that are 90% of what every developer spends their time on. Even developers at companies that make stuff that scales to billions of users, spend most of their time on stuff that doesn\u2019t, like dashboards and meme generators.\n\nAs an industry, we\u2019ve spent all our time making the hard things possible, and none of our time [making the easy things easy](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Perl-Making-Things-Possible/dp/1491954329)\n.\n\nProgrammers are all stuck in the mud. Just listen to any professional developer, and ask what percentage of their time is spent actually solving the problem they set out to work on, and how much is spent on junky overhead.\n\nIt\u2019s true here too. Our developer experience at Tailscale is better than average. But even we have largely the same experience. Modern software development is mostly junky overhead.\n\n#### The Internet[](#the-internet)\n\nIn fact, we didn\u2019t found Tailscale to be a networking company. Networking didn\u2019t come into it much at all at first.\n\nWhat really happened was, me and the Davids got together and we said, look. The problem is developers keep scaling things they don\u2019t need to scale, and their lives suck as a result. (For most programmers you can imagine the \u201cwiping your tears with a handful of dollar bills\u201d meme here.) We need to fix that. But how?\n\nWe looked at a lot of options, and talked to a lot of people, and there was an underlying cause for all the problems. The Internet. Things used to be simple. Remember the LAN? But then we connected our LANs to the Internet, and there\u2019s been more and more firewalls and attackers everywhere, and things have slowly been degrading ever since.\n\nWhen we explore the world of over-complexity, most of it has what we might call, no essential complexity. That is, the problems can be solved without complexity, but for some reason the solutions we use are complicated anyway. For example, logging systems. They just stream text from one place to another, but somehow it takes 5 minutes to show up. Or orchestration systems: they\u2019re programs whose only job is to run other programs, which Unix kernels have done just fine, within milliseconds, for decades. People layer on piles of goop. But the goop can be removed.\n\nExcept networking.\n\nYou can\u2019t build modern software without networking. But the Internet makes everything hard. Is it because networking has essential complexity?\n\nWell, maybe. But maybe it\u2019s only complex when you built it on top of the wrong assumptions, that result in the wrong problems, that you then have to paper over. That\u2019s the Old Internet.\n\nInstead of adding more layers at the very top of the OSI stack to try to hide the problems, Tailscale is building a new OSI layer 3 \u2014 a New Internet \u2014 on top of new assumptions that avoid the problems in the first place.\n\n#### Dominoes[](#dominoes)\n\nIf we fix the Internet, a whole chain of dominoes can come falling down, and we reach the next stage of technology evolution.\n\nIf you want to know the bottleneck in any particular economic system, look for who gets to charge rent. In the tech world, that\u2019s AWS. Sure, Apple\u2019s there selling popular laptops, but you could buy a different laptop or a different phone. And Microsoft was the gatekeeper for everything, once, but you don\u2019t have Windows lock-in anymore, unless you choose to. All those \u201cthe web is the new operating system\u201d people of the early 2000s finally won, we just forgot to celebrate.\n\nBut the liberation didn\u2019t last long. If you deploy software, you probably pay rent to AWS.\n\nWhy is that? Compute, right? AWS provides scalable computing resources.\n\nWell, you\u2019d think so. But lots of people sell computing resources way cheaper. Even a mid-range Macbook can do 10x or 100x more transactions per second on its SSD than a supposedly fast cloud local disk, because cloud providers sell that disk to 10 or 100 people at once while charging you full price. Why would you pay exorbitant fees instead of hosting your mission-critical website on your super fast Macbook?\n\nWe all know why:\n\n#### IPv4[](#ipv4)\n\nLocation, location, location. You pay exorbitant rents to cloud providers for their computing power because your own computer isn\u2019t in the right place to be a decent server.\n\nIt\u2019s behind a firewall and a NAT and a dynamic IP address and probably an asymmetric network link that drops out just often enough to make you nervous.\n\nYou could fix the network link. You could reconfigure the firewall, and port forward through the NAT, I guess, and if you\u2019re lucky you could pay your ISP an exorbitant rate for a static IP, and maybe get a redundant Internet link, and I know some of my coworkers actually did do all that stuff on a rack in their garage. But it\u2019s all a lot of work, and requires expertise, and it\u2019s far away from building the stupid dashboard or blog or cat video website you wanted to build in the first place. It\u2019s so much easier to just pay a hosting provider who has all the IP addresses and network bandwidth money can buy.\n\nAnd then, if you\u2019re going to pay someone, and you\u2019re a serious company, you\u2019d better buy it from someone serious, because now you have to host your stuff on their equipment which means they have access to\u2026 everything, so you need to trust them not to misuse that access.\n\nYou know what, nobody ever got fired for buying AWS.\n\nThat\u2019s an IBM analogy. We used to say, nobody ever got fired for buying IBM. I doubt that\u2019s true anymore. Why not?\n\n#### Pendulums[](#pendulums)\n\nI refuse to say pendula.\n\nIBM mainframes still exist, and they probably always will, but IBM used to be able to charge rent on every aspect of business computing, and now they can\u2019t. They started losing influence when Microsoft arrived, stealing fire from the gods of centralized computing and bringing it back to individuals using comparatively tiny underpowered PCs on every desk, in every home, running Microsoft software.\n\nI credit Microsoft with building the first widespread distributed computing systems, even though all the early networks were some variant of sneakernet.\n\nI think we can agree that we\u2019re now in a post-Microsoft, web-first world. Neat. Is this world a centralized one like IBM, or a distributed one like Microsoft?\n\n\\[When I did this as a talk, I took a poll: it was about 50/50\\]\n\nSo, bad news. The pendulum has swung back the other way. IBM was centralized, then Microsoft was distributed, and now the cloud+phone world is centralized again.\n\nWe\u2019ve built a giant centralized computer system, with a few megaproviders in the middle, and a bunch of dumb terminals on our desks and in our pockets. The dumb terminals, even our smart watches, are all supercomputers by the standards of 20 years ago, if we used them that way. But they\u2019re not much better than a VT100. Turn off AWS, and they\u2019re all bricks.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to fool ourselves into thinking the overall system is distributed. Yes, we build fancy distributed consensus systems and our servers have multiple instances. But all that runs centrally on cloud providers.\n\nThis isn\u2019t new. IBM was doing multi-core computing and virtual machines back in the 1960s. It\u2019s the same thing over again now, just with 50 years of Moore\u2019s Law on top. We still have a big monopoly that gets to charge everyone rent because they\u2019re the gatekeeper over the only thing that really matters.\n\n#### Operating Systems[](#operating-systems)\n\nSorry, just kidding.\n\nConnectivity.\n\nEveryone\u2019s attitude is still stuck in the 1990s, when operating systems mattered. That\u2019s how Microsoft stole the fire from IBM and ruled the world, because writing portable software was so hard that if you wanted to\u2026 interconnect\u2026 one program to another, if you wanted things to be compatible at all, you had to run them on the same computer, which meant you had to standardize the operating system, and that operating system was DOS, and then Windows.\n\nThe web undid that monopoly. Now javascript matters more than all the operating systems put together, and there\u2019s a new element that controls whether two programs can talk to each other: HTTPS. If you can HTTPS from one thing to another, you can interconnect. If you can\u2019t, forget it.\n\n#### Certificates[](#certificates)\n\nAnd HTTPS is fundamentally a centralized system. It has a client, and a server. A dumb terminal, and a thing that does the work. The server has a static IP address, a DNS name, a TLS certificate, and an open port. A client has none of those things. A server can keep doing whatever it wants if all the clients go away, but if the servers go away, a client does nothing.\n\nWe didn\u2019t get here on purpose, mostly. It was just path dependence. We had security problems and an IPv4 address shortage, so we added firewalls and NATs, so connections became one way from client machines to server machines, and so there was no point putting certificates on clients, and nowadays there are 10 different reasons a client can\u2019t be a server, and everyone is used to it, so we design everything around it. Dumb terminals and centralized servers.\n\nOnce that happened, of course some company popped up to own the center of the hub-and-spoke network. AWS does that center better than everyone else, fair and square. Someone had to. They won.\n\n#### Taildrop[](#taildrop)\n\nOkay, fast forward. We\u2019ve spent the last 5 years making Tailscale the solution to that problem. Every device gets a cert. Every device gets an IP address and a DNS name and end-to-end encryption and an identity, and safely bypasses firewalls. Every device can be a peer. And we do it all without adding any latency or overhead.\n\nThat\u2019s the New Internet. We built it! It\u2019s the future, it\u2019s just unevenly distributed, so far. For people with Tailscale, we\u2019ve already sliced out 10 layers of nonsense. That\u2019s why developers react so viscerally once they get it. Tailscale makes the Internet work how you thought the Internet worked, before you learned how the Internet works.\n\nI like to use [Taildrop as an example of what that makes possible](https://tailscale.com/blog/2021-06-taildrop-was-easy)\n. Taildrop is a little feature we spent a few months on back when we were tiny. We should spend more time polishing to make it even easier to use. But at its core, it\u2019s a demo app. As long as you have Tailscale already, Taildrop is just one HTTP PUT operation. The sender makes an HTTP request to the receiver, says \u201chere\u2019s a file named X\u201d, and sends the file. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s the most obvious thing in the world. Why would you do it any other way?\n\nWell, before Tailscale, you didn\u2019t have a choice. The receiver is another client device, not a server. So it was behind a firewall, with no open ports and no identity. Your only option was to upload the file to the cloud and then download it again, even if the sender and receiver are side by side on the same wifi. But that means you pay cloud fees for network egress, and storage, and the CPU time for running whatever server program is managing all that stuff. And if you upload the file and nobody downloads it, you need a rule for when to delete it from storage. And also you pay fees just in case to keep the server online, even when you\u2019re not using it at all. Also, cloud employees can theoretically access the file unless you encrypt it. But you can\u2019t encrypt it without exchanging encryption keys somehow between sender and recipient. And how does the receiver even know a file is there waiting to be received in the first place? Do we need a push notification system? For every client platform? And so on. Layers, and layers, and layers of gunk.\n\nAnd all that gunk means rent to cloud providers. Transferring files \u2014 one of the first things people did on the Internet, for no extra charge, via FTP \u2014 now has to cost money, because somebody has got to pay that rent.\n\nWith Taildrop, it doesn\u2019t cost money. Not because we\u2019re generously draining our bank accounts to make file transfers free. It\u2019s because the [cost overhead is gone altogether](https://tailscale.com/blog/free-plan)\n, because it\u2019s not built on the same devolved Internet everyone else has been using.\n\n#### The New Internet[](#the-new-internet)\n\nTaildrop is just an example, a trivial one, but it\u2019s an existence proof for a whole class of programs that can be 10x easier just because Tailscale exists.\n\nThe chain of dominoes starts with connectivity. Lack of connectivity is why we get centralization, and centralization is why we pay rent for every tiny little program we want to run and why everything is slow and tedious and complicated and hard to debug like an IBM batch job. And we\u2019re about to start those dominoes falling.\n\nThe glimpse at these possibilities is why our users get excited about Tailscale, more than they\u2019ve ever been excited about some VPN or proxy, because there\u2019s something underneath our kind of VPN that you can\u2019t get anywhere else. We\u2019re removing layers, and layers, and layers of complexity, and making it easier to work on what you wanted to work on in the first place. Not everybody sees it yet, but they will. And when they do, they\u2019re going to be able to invent things we could never imagine in the old centralized world, just like the Windows era of distributed computing made things possible that were unthinkable on a mainframe.\n\nBut there\u2019s one catch. If we\u2019re going to untangle the hairball of connectivity, that connectivity has to apply to\u2026\n\n#### Everyone[](#everyone)\n\nThere\u2019s going to be a new world of haves and have-nots. Where in 1970 you had or didn\u2019t have a mainframe, and in 1995 you had or didn\u2019t have the Internet, and today you have or don\u2019t have a TLS cert, tomorrow you\u2019ll have or not have Tailscale. And if you don\u2019t, you won\u2019t be able to run apps that only work in a post-Tailscale world.\n\nAnd if not enough people have Tailscale, nobody will build those apps. That\u2019s called a [chicken-and-egg problem](https://apenwarr.ca/log/20201227)\n.\n\nThis is why our company strategy sounds so odd at first glance. It's why we spend so much effort giving Tailscale away for free, but also so much effort getting people to bring it to work, and so much effort doing tangential enterprise features so executives can easily roll it out to whole Fortune 500 companies.\n\nThe Internet is for everyone. You know, there were internetworks (lowercase) before the Internet (capitalized). They all lost, because the Internet was the most diverse and inclusive of all. To the people building the Internet, nothing mattered but getting everyone connected. Adoption was slow at first, then fast, then really fast, and today, if I buy a wristwatch and it doesn\u2019t have an Internet link, it\u2019s broken.\n\nWe won\u2019t have built a New Internet if nerds at home can\u2019t play with it. Or nerds at universities. Or employees at enterprises. Or, you know, eventually every person everywhere.\n\n#### Vision[](#vision)\n\nThere remain a lot of steps between here and there. But, let\u2019s save those details for another time. Meanwhile, how are we doing?\n\nWell, about 1 in 20,000 people in the world uses the New Internet (that\u2019s Tailscale). We\u2019re not going to stop until it\u2019s all of them.\n\nI\u2019m old enough to remember when people made fun of Microsoft for their thing about putting a computer on every desk. Or when TCP/IP was an optional add-on you had to buy from a third party.\n\nYou know, all that was less than 30 years ago. I\u2019m old, but come to think of it, I\u2019m not that old. The tech world changes fast. It can change for the better. We\u2019re just getting started.\n\nSubscribe to Tailscale\u2019s blog\n-----------------------------\n\nWe have a deep commitment to keeping your data safe.\n\nToo much email?[RSS](/blog/index.xml)\n[X](https://twitter.com/tailscale)\n\nLoading...\n\nTry Tailscale for free\n----------------------\n\n[Get started](https://login.tailscale.com/start)\n\nSchedule a demo\n\n[Contact sales](/contact/sales)\n\n![cta phone](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/w77i7m8x/production/b715b4ca5e2577da60f0d529a4a9bc2ad4cadf59-362x567.svg?w=750&q=75&fit=clip&auto=format)\n\n![mercury](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/w77i7m8x/production/459a7a8492910eeb22f22bb8d4c0f864b0bae25f-199x81.svg?w=640&q=75&fit=clip&auto=format)\n\n![instacrt](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/w77i7m8x/production/7d127f4bb62a408b056328349f291857df6251b3-199x81.svg?w=640&q=75&fit=clip&auto=format)\n\n![Retool](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/w77i7m8x/production/e9579b00087d7896e9cb750f4eb39f2c11ed11b8-199x82.svg?w=640&q=75&fit=clip&auto=format)\n\n![duolingo](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/w77i7m8x/production/7958bf3d43a30e661ca74cf0510f250d9b99ecef-199x81.svg?w=640&q=75&fit=clip&auto=format)\n\n![Hugging Face](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/w77i7m8x/production/68e2e5024898bcd6f6d142e0306dc7564787e1d7-199x82.svg?w=640&q=75&fit=clip&auto=format)\n\n-----\nGenerate comments in a hierarchical structure with 3 comments per level, up to a depth of 3."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n- **teddyh** (): The eternal problem with companies like Tailscale (and Cloudflare, Google, etc. etc.) is that, by solving a problem with the modern internet which the internet should have been designed to solve by itself, like simple end-to-end secure connectivity, Tailscale becomes <i>incentivized to keep the problem</i>. What the internet would need is something like IPv6 with automatic encryption via IPsec, with PKI provided by DNSSEC. But Tailscale has every incentive to <i>prevent</i> such things to be widely and compatibly implemented, because it would destroy their business. Their whole business depends on the problem persisting.<p>(Repost of &lt;<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38570370\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38570370</a>&gt;)\n  - **hnarn** (): This sounds like a reasonable point, but the more I think about it, the more it sounds like digital flagellation.<p>IPv6 was released in 1998. It had been 21 (!) years since the release of IPv6 and still what you&#x27;re describing had not been implemented when Tailscale was released in 2019. Who was stopping anyone from doing it then, and who is stopping anyone from doing it now?<p>It&#x27;s easy to paint companies as bad actors, especially since they often are, but Google, Cloudflare and Tailscale all became what they are for a reason: they solved a real problem, so people gave them money, or whatever is money-equivalent, like personal data.<p>If your argument is inverted, it&#x27;s a kind of inverse accelerationism (decelerationism?) whereby only in making the Internet worse for everyone, the <i>really</i> good solutions can see the light. I don&#x27;t buy it.<p>Tailscale is not the reason we&#x27;re not seeing what you&#x27;re describing, the immense work involved in creating it is why, and it&#x27;s only when that immense amount of work becomes slightly less immense that any solution at all emerges. Tailscale for example would probably not exist if they had to invent Wireguard, and the fact that Tailscale now exists has led to Headscale existing, creating yet another springboard in a line of springboards to create &quot;something&quot; like what you describe -- for those willing to put in the time.\n    - **throw0101d** (): &gt; <i>Who was stopping anyone from doing it then, and who is stopping anyone from doing it now?</i><p>The folks who either (a) got in early on the IPv4 address land rush (especially the Western developed countries), or (b) with buckets of money who buy addresses.<p>If you&#x27;re India, there probably weren&#x27;t enough IPv4 address in the first place to handle your population, so you&#x27;re doing IPv6:<p>* <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;intl&#x2F;en&#x2F;ipv6&#x2F;statistics.html#tab=per-country-ipv6-adoption\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;intl&#x2F;en&#x2F;ipv6&#x2F;statistics.html#tab=per-...</a><p>Or even if you&#x27;re in the West, if you&#x27;re poor (a community Native American ISP):<p>&gt; <i>We learned a very expensive lesson.  71% of the IPv4 traffic we were supporting was from ROKU devices. 9% coming from DishNetwork &amp; DirectTV satellite tuners,  11% from HomeSecurity cameras and systems, and remaining 9% we replaced extremely outdated Point of Sale(POS) equipment.

Who was stopping anyone from doing it then, and who is stopping anyone from doing it now?<p>Well, for a long time, IPv6 didn&#x27;t work very well. We&#x27;re past that, mostly. Google reports that 45% of their incoming connections worldwide are IPv6.[1]\nGrowth rate has been close to linear, at 4%&#x2F;year, since 2015. IPv6 should pass 50% some time in 2025.<p>Mobile is already 70%-90% IPv6. They need a lot of addresses.<p>Most of the delay comes from enterprise networks. They have limited connectivity to the outside world, and much of that limiting involves some kind of address translation.

The problems which SRV (and now HTTPS) DNS records solves is not a problem <i>for Google</i>, since they solved the problem by sheer scale and brute force, and Google only benefits from everybody else still having the problem;  it\u2019s a great moat for them.\n  - **Animats** (): And, worse, incentivized to require users to use a &quot;coordination server&quot; which helps with the NAT and firewall traversal problem by being something you can reach from outbound-only clients.  There&#x27;s a lot of verbiage there, but the general idea seems to be that Tailscale sits at the middle of this as the means by which machines find each other.<p>There are other ways to do that.<p>There are dynamic DNS schemes, so you can give your machine which only has a temporary IP address a permanent name. That&#x27;s been around for decades, and seems to have a bad reputation.<p>There are schemes with multiple coordination nodes that know about each other, and published lists of such nodes. The list may be out of date, but as long as the published list has one live node, you can connect and get updated. That&#x27;s how Kademlia, which underlies Etherium&#x27;s network and some file sharing systems, works. That&#x27;s about 20 years old, and sort of has a sketchy reputation.<p>It&#x27;s possible to go only halfway, and separate discovery from transmission. Peertube does that. You find a file to stream via ordinary HTTP to a server you find by ordinary web search means. Anybody can set up such a server. The actual streaming, for files wanted by many clients, is distributed, with people currently watching also sending out blocks to other people watching. This scales well, in case your video goes viral. It&#x27;s not used much, though.<p>So it&#x27;s definitely possible to do this without someone in the middle able to cut off your air supply.\n    - **pphysch** (): How is trusting a dynamic DNS provider different than trusting Tailscale&#x27;s coordination nodes?\n  - **ZhongXina** (): No, we definitely don&#x27;t want &quot;automatic IPSec&quot; (especially IPSec!), or really any enforced encryption at the network level, even if it&#x27;s something sane <i>at this moment</i> like WireGuard. Look at old VPN protocols or authentication schemes like RADIUS which have glaring security holes and are impossible to fix because of compatibility issues, and they&#x27;re running at much smaller scales than the whole internet. Hell, the way the industry is solving TCP ossification problems is by throwing TCP away and reimplementing it on top of UDP, that should tell us something.\n    - **teddyh** (): Your argument seems to be to never implement anything, because eventually it will become old and it will be hard to move away from it?  This seems to be an argument against <i>anything</i> new, and it is therefore hard to take seriously.\n    - **jeroenhd** (): IPSec is still widely deployed, securely even. All manual, of course, because it doesn&#x27;t do the stuff that makes HTTPS easy.<p>IPSec is not always a VPN protocol. L2TP over IPSec is often used as one, but IPSec does little more than encrypt a tunnel between two IP addresses. IPSec in tunnel mode can be a minimal VPN, but it&#x27;s not used as such as in VPN scenarios without a second packet encapsulation protocol, as it lacks authorization beyond key exchange.<p>As for the risk of ossification: that didn&#x27;t go away with the current system either. HTTPS over TLS 1.3 looks like a TLS 1.2 session resumption on the wire (in its default configuration) because shitty middleboxes are used often enough that it would impede the protocol.<p>The &quot;let&#x27;s remake TCP over UDP&quot; approach QUIC takes has very similar origins. UDP is generally allowed by random firewalls over that network, while other (more suited) protocols for this type of stuff like SCTP are not. The operating system doesn&#x27;t allow opening raw network sockets without high privileges, so adding a new QUIC protocol at the layer of TCP and UDP to implement them  at the right spot in the stack wouldn&#x27;t be usable for many devices. Same is true for the TCP stack you have to use what the OS provides or get higher privileges to do your own; patching the TCP state machine isn&#x27;t practical. So, if you want to implement a better version of TCP optimised for web browsing and such, you use UDP, because while technically incorrect, it&#x27;ll work in most cases and has the least restrictions.<p>In the context of the network, IPSec is the new protocol here, not the result of ossification.\n- **jclulow** (): An incredibly long ramp up to complaining about centralised control by rent seekers (a very reasonable complaint!) which gets bogged down in some ostensibly unrelated shade about whether client-server computing makes sense (it does) or is itself somehow responsible for the rent seeking (it isn&#x27;t; you can seek rent on proprietary peer to peer systems as well!) to then arrive at:<p>&gt; There\u2019s going to be a new world of haves and have-nots.

It is small and simple enough even I, a non-programmer, can make modifications.<p>It&#x27;s possible one ends up using client-server in order to achieve peer-to-peer because not everyone has an internet-reachable, non-firewalled IP address.  Using some hosting company&#x27;s server to run a &quot;supernode&quot; may be required.  No traffic needs to pass through it if it is used only as a &quot;rendezvous server&quot; so the cost can be minimal.<p>Companies that try to compete with &quot;free&quot; always draw high scrutiny from me.  Stop using that free software and start paying us.  We added 100 unnecessary &quot;features&quot;.<p>Not doubting this &quot;corporate strategy&quot; can succeed, at least short-term.  Look at Slack.  But these subscriptions are not for me.<p>Client-server versus peer-to-peer is misdirection.  The real issue is proprietary versus non-proprietary.  IMHO.\n    - **HumanOstrich** (): What is the non-proprietary option you are referring to?\n  - **cookiengineer** (): Honestly, I kind of missed Hamachi in the last decades.<p>It was such a superb and easy to use tool to design&#x2F;configure your own private networks at the time. Filesharing, local game LANs, development cooperation, heck, even media streaming was so easily done at the time.<p>Personally I think that the future of peer to peer isn&#x27;t tailscale, it&#x27;s more someting along the lines of a selfhosted hamachi variant that&#x27;s able to put generically nodes together from all across different NATs and ASNs, generically understanding NAT breaking techniques and STUN&#x2F;TURN&#x2F;turtle routing.<p>A tool like this that could also allow remote users to chime in without a centralized VPN gateway would be a killer feature for the modern world.\n    - **wmf** (): That sounds a lot like Headscale.\n  - **ssss11** (): Lol. The tailscale CEO is preaching \u201ctomorrow you\u2019ll have or not have Tailscale. And if you don\u2019t, you won\u2019t be able to run apps that only work in a post-Tailscale world.\u201d??<p>That won\u2019t go down well in 10 years if they don\u2019t become Microsoft-scale juggernauts.\n    - **IAmNotACellist** (): Or they&#x27;ll just get bought by Microsoft, Amazon, or Cloudflare and that&#x27;ll be that<p>I like Tailscale just because it&#x27;s OpenVPN without the unbearable agony of setting it up so it actually works\n    - **01HNNWZ0MV43FF** (): Yeah it&#x27;s a weird flex. I&#x27;d use Tailscale today if it was open all the way up and down.<p>If not, why bother? TLS and http don&#x27;t charge licensing fees...\n- **k_bx** (): I&#x27;m one of the people who actually use Tailscale for production systems where there are servers physically close to me, or at some other controlled locations, and then there are hundreds of users hundreds kilometers away, all working via Tailscale.<p>I should say two things. Tailscale is amazing and I love it. The system could not exist without it, or I&#x27;d have to have at least ten more people in my team to manage all this 24&#x2F;7. It&#x27;s working, and it&#x27;s good enough.<p>That being said, you do need to lower your expectations: it&#x27;s not as good as &quot;the internet&quot;. The latency spikes periodically, the connection drops sometimes, the MagicDNS just magically stops working or interferes with the system. Since we have many users, we&#x27;ve encountered every possible problem one can encounter, and then there&#x27;s still something new you&#x27;ll see tomorrow.<p>In any case, we believe in Tailscale and its vision, it&#x27;s a categorically new approach that simultaneously gives you the control on hardware, reduces the cost, and improves the security. Our first big production server was a 4-core Linux Laptop!<p>We love Tailscale and we wish the product prosperous life and development. Thank you TEAM TAILSCALE!\n  - **aquariusDue** (): Would you mind going into more detail about the 4-core Linux Laptop as a production server via Tailscale, please? I too use Tailscale and love it for self-hosting internal stuff but I never thought about using it for public facing production stuff. Now I&#x27;m really curious to hear more about your setup (if you&#x27;re willing to share of course).\n    - **phantompeace** (): Not the person you\u2019ve asked but I regularly use it for backends for projects. Connect your database machine to your Tailscale network and have your code talk over the Tailscale IP to connect to it. I\u2019ve served multiple Flask frontends that have talked to backends this way - works great! I use various cloud VMs to host the frontend, and they all talk to an Optiplex Micro box under my desk for their backends.\n    - **k_bx** (): It&#x27;s very simple. We needed to begin somewhere, and until we&#x27;ve had at least 10-20 active users which load our database with their analytics queries, we wouldn&#x27;t require a lot in terms of compute power and speed. However, we do have electricity stability problems sometimes (and internet outage), so something which has its own battery and ability to switch to a backup wifi&#x2F;lte was a great choice as a start.<p>So that laptop was a &quot;free server&quot; we&#x27;ve had. It&#x27;s now replaced by a much beefier miniPC.\n"}]}

Summary\n===========\n\nSQLite reads and writes small blobs (for example, thumbnail images) [35% faster\u00b9](#approx)\n than the same blobs can be read from or written to individual files on disk using fread() or fwrite().\n\nFurthermore, a single SQLite database holding 10-kilobyte blobs uses about 20% less disk space than storing the blobs in individual files.\n\nThe performance difference arises (we believe) because when working from an SQLite database, the open() and close() system calls are invoked only once, whereas open() and close() are invoked once for each blob when using blobs stored in individual files. It appears that the overhead of calling open() and close() is greater than the overhead of using the database. The size reduction arises from the fact that individual files are padded out to the next multiple of the filesystem block size, whereas the blobs are packed more tightly into an SQLite database.\n\nThe measurements in this article were made during the week of 2017-06-05 using a version of SQLite in between 3.19.2 and 3.20.0. You may expect future versions of SQLite to perform even better.\n\n1.1. Caveats\n------------\n\n\u00b9The 35% figure above is approximate. Actual timings vary depending on hardware, operating system, and the details of the experiment, and due to random performance fluctuations on real-world hardware. See the text below for more detail. Try the experiments yourself. Report significant deviations on the [SQLite forum](support.html#fx)\n.\n\nThe 35% figure is based on running tests on every machine that the author has easily at hand. Some reviewers of this article report that SQLite has higher latency than direct I/O on their systems. We do not yet understand the difference. We also see indications that SQLite does not perform as well as direct I/O when experiments are run using a cold filesystem cache.\n\nSo let your take-away be this: read/write latency for SQLite is competitive with read/write latency of individual files on disk. Often SQLite is faster. Sometimes SQLite is almost as fast. Either way, this article disproves the common assumption that a relational database must be slower than direct filesystem I/O.\n\n1.2. Related Studies\n--------------------\n\nA [2022 study](https://golangexample.com/an-unscientific-benchmark-of-sqlite-vs-the-file-system-btrfs/)\n ([alternative link on GitHub](https://github.com/chrisdavies/dbench)\n) found that SQLite is _roughly_ twice as fast at real-world workloads compared to Btrfs and Ext4 on Linux.\n\n[Jim Gray](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/gray/)\n and others studied the read performance of BLOBs versus file I/O for Microsoft SQL Server and found that reading BLOBs out of the database was faster for BLOB sizes less than between 250KiB and 1MiB. ([Paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/to-blob-or-not-to-blob-large-object-storage-in-a-database-or-a-filesystem/)\n). In that study, the database still stores the filename of the content even if the content is held in a separate file. So the database is consulted for every BLOB, even if it is only to extract the filename. In this article, the key for the BLOB is the filename, so no preliminary database access is required. Because the database is never used at all when reading content from individual files in this article, the threshold at which direct file I/O becomes faster is smaller than it is in Gray's paper.\n\nThe [Internal Versus External BLOBs](intern-v-extern-blob.html)\n article on this website is an earlier investigation (circa 2011) that uses the same approach as the Jim Gray paper \u2014 storing the blob filenames as entries in the database \u2014 but for SQLite instead of SQL Server.\n\n2\\. How These Measurements Are Made\n===================================\n\nI/O performance is measured using the [kvtest.c](https://www.sqlite.org/src/file/test/kvtest.c)\n program from the SQLite source tree. To compile this test program, first gather the kvtest.c source file into a directory with the [SQLite amalgamation](amalgamation.html)\n source files \"sqlite3.c\" and \"sqlite3.h\". Then on unix, run a command like the following:\n\ngcc -Os -I. -DSQLITE\\_DIRECT\\_OVERFLOW\\_READ \\\\\n  kvtest.c sqlite3.c -o kvtest -ldl -lpthread\n\nOr on Windows with MSVC:\n\ncl -I. -DSQLITE\\_DIRECT\\_OVERFLOW\\_READ kvtest.c sqlite3.c\n\nInstructions for compiling for Android are [shown below](#compile-android)\n.\n\nUse the resulting \"kvtest\" program to generate a test database with 100,000 random uncompressible blobs, each with a random size between 8,000 and 12,000 bytes using a command like this:\n\n./kvtest init test1.db --count 100k --size 10k --variance 2k\n\nIf desired, you can verify the new database by running this command:\n\n./kvtest stat test1.db\n\nNext, make copies of all the blobs into individual files in a directory using a command like this:\n\n./kvtest export test1.db test1.dir\n\nAt this point, you can measure the amount of disk space used by the test1.db database and the space used by the test1.dir directory and all of its content. On a standard Ubuntu Linux desktop, the database file will be 1,024,512,000 bytes in size and the test1.dir directory will use 1,228,800,000 bytes of space (according to \"du -k\"), about 20% more than the database.\n\nThe \"test1.dir\" directory created above puts all the blobs into a single folder. It was conjectured that some operating systems would perform poorly when a single directory contains 100,000 objects. To test this, the kvtest program can also store the blobs in a hierarchy of folders with no more than 100 files and/or subdirectories per folder. The alternative on-disk representation of the blobs can be created using the --tree command-line option to the \"export\" command, like this:\n\n./kvtest export test1.db test1.tree --tree\n\nThe test1.dir directory will contain 100,000 files with names like \"000000\", \"000001\", \"000002\" and so forth but the test1.tree directory will contain the same files in subdirectories like \"00/00/00\", \"00/00/01\", and so on. The test1.dir and test1.test directories take up approximately the same amount of space, though test1.test is very slightly larger due to the extra directory entries.\n\nAll of the experiments that follow operate the same with either \"test1.dir\" or \"test1.tree\". Very little performance difference is measured in either case, regardless of operating system.\n\nMeasure the performance for reading blobs from the database and from individual files using these commands:\n\n./kvtest run test1.db --count 100k --blob-api\n./kvtest run test1.dir --count 100k --blob-api\n./kvtest run test1.tree --count 100k --blob-api\n\nDepending on your hardware and operating system, you should see that reads from the test1.db database file are about 35% faster than reads from individual files in the test1.dir or test1.tree folders. Results can vary significantly from one run to the next due to caching, so it is advisable to run tests multiple times and take an average or a worst case or a best case, depending on your requirements.\n\nThe --blob-api option on the database read test causes kvtest to use the [sqlite3\\_blob\\_read()](c3ref/blob_read.html)\n feature of SQLite to load the content of the blobs, rather than running pure SQL statements. This helps SQLite to run a little faster on read tests. You can omit that option to compare the performance of SQLite running SQL statements. In that case, the SQLite still out-performs direct reads, though by not as much as when using [sqlite3\\_blob\\_read()](c3ref/blob_read.html)\n. The --blob-api option is ignored for tests that read from individual disk files.\n\nMeasure write performance by adding the --update option. This causes the blobs are overwritten in place with another random blob of exactly the same size.\n\n./kvtest run test1.db --count 100k --update\n./kvtest run test1.dir --count 100k --update\n./kvtest run test1.tree --count 100k --update\n\nThe writing test above is not completely fair, since SQLite is doing [power-safe transactions](transactional.html)\n whereas the direct-to-disk writing is not. To put the tests on a more equal footing, add either the --nosync option to the SQLite writes to disable calling fsync() or FlushFileBuffers() to force content to disk, or using the --fsync option for the direct-to-disk tests to force them to invoke fsync() or FlushFileBuffers() when updating disk files.\n\nBy default, kvtest runs the database I/O measurements all within a single transaction. Use the --multitrans option to run each blob read or write in a separate transaction. The --multitrans option makes SQLite much slower, and uncompetitive with direct disk I/O. This option proves, yet again, that to get the most performance out of SQLite, you should group as much database interaction as possible within a single transaction.\n\nThere are many other testing options, which can be seen by running the command:\n\n./kvtest help\n\n2.1. Read Performance Measurements\n----------------------------------\n\nThe chart below shows data collected using [kvtest.c](https://www.sqlite.org/src/file/test/kvtest.c)\n on five different systems:\n\n*   **Win7**: A circa-2009 Dell Inspiron laptop, Pentium dual-core at 2.30GHz, 4GiB RAM, Windows7.\n*   **Win10**: A 2016 Lenovo YOGA 910, Intel i7-7500 at 2.70GHz, 16GiB RAM, Windows10.\n*   **Mac**: A 2015 MacBook Pro, 3.1GHz intel Core i7, 16GiB RAM, MacOS 10.12.5\n*   **Ubuntu**: Desktop built from Intel i7-4770K at 3.50GHz, 32GiB RAM, Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS\n*   **Android**: Galaxy S3, ARMv7, 2GiB RAM\n\nAll machines use SSD except Win7 which has a hard-drive. The test database is 100K blobs with sizes uniformly distributed between 8K and 12K, for a total of about 1 gigabyte of content. The database page size is 4KiB. The -DSQLITE\\_DIRECT\\_OVERFLOW\\_READ compile-time option was used for all of these tests. Tests were run multiple times. The first run was used to warm up the cache and its timings were discarded.\n\nThe chart below shows average time to read a blob directly from the filesystem versus the time needed to read the same blob from the SQLite database. The actual timings vary considerably from one system to another (the Ubuntu desktop is much faster than the Galaxy S3 phone, for example). This chart shows the ratio of the times needed to read blobs from a file divided by the time needed to from the database. The left-most column in the chart is the normalized time to read from the database, for reference.\n\nIn this chart, an SQL statement (\"SELECT v FROM kv WHERE k=?1\") is prepared once. Then for each blob, the blob key value is bound to the ?1 parameter and the statement is evaluated to extract the blob content.\n\nThe chart shows that on Windows10, content can be read from the SQLite database about 5 times faster than it can be read directly from disk. On Android, SQLite is only about 35% faster than reading from disk.\n\n![](https://sqlite.org/images/faster-read-sql.jpg)\n\n  \nChart 1: SQLite read latency relative to direct filesystem reads.  \n100K blobs, avg 10KB each, random order using SQL\n\nThe performance can be improved slightly by bypassing the SQL layer and reading the blob content directly using the [sqlite3\\_blob\\_read()](c3ref/blob_read.html)\n interface, as shown in the next chart:\n\n![](https://sqlite.org/images/faster-read-blobapi.jpg)\n\n  \nChart 2: SQLite read latency relative to direct filesystem reads.  \n100K blobs, avg size 10KB, random order  \nusing sqlite3\\_blob\\_read().\n\nFurther performance improves can be made by using the [memory-mapped I/O](mmap.html)\n feature of SQLite. In the next chart, the entire 1GB database file is memory mapped and blobs are read (in random order) using the [sqlite3\\_blob\\_read()](c3ref/blob_read.html)\n interface. With these optimizations, SQLite is twice as fast as Android or MacOS-X and over 10 times faster than Windows.\n\n![](https://sqlite.org/images/faster-read-mmap.jpg)\n\n  \nChart 3: SQLite read latency relative to direct filesystem reads.  \n100K blobs, avg size 10KB, random order  \nusing sqlite3\\_blob\\_read() from a memory-mapped database.\n\nThe third chart shows that reading blob content out of SQLite can be twice as fast as reading from individual files on disk for Mac and Android, and an amazing ten times faster for Windows.\n\n2.2. Write Performance Measurements\n-----------------------------------\n\nWrites are slower. On all systems, using both direct I/O and SQLite, write performance is between 5 and 15 times slower than reads.\n\nWrite performance measurements were made by replacing (overwriting) an entire blob with a different blob. All of the blobs in these experiment are random and incompressible. Because writes are so much slower than reads, only 10,000 of the 100,000 blobs in the database are replaced. The blobs to be replaced are selected at random and are in no particular order.\n\nThe direct-to-disk writes are accomplished using fopen()/fwrite()/fclose(). By default, and in all the results shown below, the OS filesystem buffers are never flushed to persistent storage using fsync() or FlushFileBuffers(). In other words, there is no attempt to make the direct-to-disk writes transactional or power-safe. We found that invoking fsync() or FlushFileBuffers() on each file written causes direct-to-disk storage to be about 10 times or more slower than writes to SQLite.\n\nThe next chart compares SQLite database updates in [WAL mode](wal.html)\n against raw direct-to-disk overwrites of separate files on disk. The [PRAGMA synchronous](pragma.html#pragma_synchronous)\n setting is NORMAL. All database writes are in a single transaction. The timer for the database writes is stopped after the transaction commits, but before a [checkpoint](wal.html#ckpt)\n is run. Note that the SQLite writes, unlike the direct-to-disk writes, are [transactional](transactional.html)\n and [power-safe](transactional.html)\n, though because the synchronous setting is NORMAL instead of FULL, the transactions are not durable.\n\n![](https://sqlite.org/images/faster-write-safe.jpg)\n\n  \nChart 4: SQLite write latency relative to direct filesystem writes.  \n10K blobs, avg size 10KB, random order,  \nWAL mode with synchronous NORMAL,  \nexclusive of checkpoint time\n\nThe android performance numbers for the write experiments are omitted because the performance tests on the Galaxy S3 are so random. Two consecutive runs of the exact same experiment would give wildly different times. And, to be fair, the performance of SQLite on android is slightly slower than writing directly to disk.\n\nThe next chart shows the performance of SQLite versus direct-to-disk when transactions are disabled ([PRAGMA journal\\_mode=OFF](pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode)\n) and [PRAGMA synchronous](pragma.html#pragma_synchronous)\n is set to OFF. These settings put SQLite on an equal footing with direct-to-disk writes, which is to say they make the data prone to corruption due to system crashes and power failures.\n\n![](https://sqlite.org/images/faster-write-unsafe.jpg)\n\n  \nChart 5: SQLite write latency relative to direct filesystem writes.  \n10K blobs, avg size 10KB, random order,  \njournaling disabled, synchronous OFF.\n\nIn all of the write tests, it is important to disable anti-virus software prior to running the direct-to-disk performance tests. We found that anti-virus software slows down direct-to-disk by an order of magnitude whereas it impacts SQLite writes very little. This is probably due to the fact that direct-to-disk changes thousands of separate files which all need to be checked by anti-virus, whereas SQLite writes only changes the single database file.\n\n2.3. Variations\n---------------\n\nThe [\\-DSQLITE\\_DIRECT\\_OVERFLOW\\_READ](compile.html#direct_overflow_read)\n compile-time option causes SQLite to bypass its page cache when reading content from overflow pages. This helps database reads of 10K blobs run a little faster, but not all that much faster. SQLite still holds a speed advantage over direct filesystem reads without the SQLITE\\_DIRECT\\_OVERFLOW\\_READ compile-time option.\n\nOther compile-time options such as using -O3 instead of -Os or using [\\-DSQLITE\\_THREADSAFE=0](compile.html#threadsafe)\n and/or some of the other [recommended compile-time options](compile.html#rcmd)\n might help SQLite to run even faster relative to direct filesystem reads.\n\nThe size of the blobs in the test data affects performance. The filesystem will generally be faster for larger blobs, since the overhead of open() and close() is amortized over more bytes of I/O, whereas the database will be more efficient in both speed and space as the average blob size decreases.\n\n3\\. General Findings\n====================\n\n1.  SQLite is competitive with, and usually faster than, blobs stored in separate files on disk, for both reading and writing.\n    \n2.  SQLite is much faster than direct writes to disk on Windows when anti-virus protection is turned on. Since anti-virus software is and should be on by default in Windows, that means that SQLite is generally much faster than direct disk writes on Windows.\n    \n3.  Reading is about an order of magnitude faster than writing, for all systems and for both SQLite and direct-to-disk I/O.\n    \n4.  I/O performance varies widely depending on operating system and hardware. Make your own measurements before drawing conclusions.\n    \n5.  Some other SQL database engines advise developers to store blobs in separate files and then store the filename in the database. In that case, where the database must first be consulted to find the filename before opening and reading the file, simply storing the entire blob in the database gives much faster read and write performance with SQLite. See the [Internal Versus External BLOBs](intern-v-extern-blob.html)\n     article for more information.\n    \n\n4\\. Additional Notes\n====================\n\n4.1. Compiling And Testing on Android\n-------------------------------------\n\nThe kvtest program is compiled and run on Android as follows. First install the Android SDK and NDK. Then prepare a script named \"android-gcc\" that looks approximately like this:\n\n#!/bin/sh\n#\nNDK=/home/drh/Android/Sdk/ndk-bundle\nSYSROOT=$NDK/platforms/android-16/arch-arm\nABIN=$NDK/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.9/prebuilt/linux-x86\\_64/bin\nGCC=$ABIN/arm-linux-androideabi-gcc\n$GCC --sysroot=$SYSROOT -fPIC -pie $\\*\n\nMake that script executable and put it on your $PATH. Then compile the kvtest program as follows:\n\nandroid-gcc -Os -I. kvtest.c sqlite3.c -o kvtest-android\n\nNext, move the resulting kvtest-android executable to the Android device:\n\nadb push kvtest-android /data/local/tmp\n\nFinally use \"adb shell\" to get a shell prompt on the Android device, cd into the /data/local/tmp directory, and begin running the tests as with any other unix host.\n\n_This page last modified on [2023-12-05 14:43:20](https://sqlite.org/docsrc/honeypot)\n UTC_\n\n-----\nGenerate comments in a hierarchical structure with 3 comments per level, up to a depth of 3."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n- **tgtweak** (): No file system attributes or metadata on records which also means no (xattrs&#x2F;fattrs) being written or updated, no checks to see if it&#x27;s a physical file or a pipe&#x2F;symlink, no permission checks, no block size alignment mismatches, single open command.<p>Makes sense when you consider you&#x27;re throwing out functionality and disregarding general purpose design.<p>If you use a fuse mapping to SQLite, mount that directory and access it, you&#x27;d probably be very similar performance (perhaps even slower) and storage use as you&#x27;d need to add additional columns in the table to track these attributes.<p>I have no doubt that you could create a custom tuned file system on a dedicated mount with attributes disabled, minimized file table and correct&#x2F;optimized block size and get very near to this perf.<p>Let&#x27;s not forget the simplicity of being able to use shell commands (like rsync) to browse and manipulate those files without running the application or an SQL client to debug.<p>Makes sense for developers to use SQLite for this use case though for an appliance-type application or for packaged static assets (this is already commonplace in game development - a cab file is essentially the same concept)\n  - **pas** (): &gt; tuned FS + dedicated mount<p>For example, Ceph uses RocksDB as their metadata DB (and it&#x27;s recommend to put it) directly on a block device, with the WAL on yet another separate raw device<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.ceph.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;rados&#x2F;configuration&#x2F;bluestore-config-ref&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.ceph.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;rados&#x2F;configuration&#x2F;bluestor...</a>\n    - **tgtweak** (): More just this:<p>mke2fs -t ext4 -b 1024 -N 100000 -O ^has_journal,^uninit_bg,^ext_attr,^huge_file,^64bit [&#x2F;dev&#x2F;sdx]<p>(smaller block size, 100,000 inode file table entries (tuned to the number of blobs), no journal, no checksumming, no extended file attributes, use smaller integer file offset IDs, 32 bit padded vs 64 bit)<p>Then mount it and run the same test.<p>You could go even further and tune fopen BUFSIZE to be no greater than 12,000 bytes.

It was always interesting to compare the constraints and assumptions across the two systems. I remember one of the big differences was the scale of individual records we expected to be working with, which in turn affected how memory and disk was managed. Most relational databases are very much optimized for small individual records and eventual consistency, which allows them to cache a lot more in memory. On the other hand, performance often drops sharply with the size of your rows.\n"}]}

The business took off, and its founders made a lot of money and received the credit they deserved for being daring visionaries. But around the same time, Bill Gates and Paul Allen came up with an idea even stranger and more fantastical: selling computer operating systems. This was much weirder than the idea of Jobs and Wozniak. A computer at least had some sort of physical reality to it. It came in a box, you could open it up and plug it in and watch lights blink. An operating system had no tangible incarnation at all. It arrived on a disk, of course, but the disk was, in effect, nothing more than the box that the OS came in. The product itself was a very long string of ones and zeroes that, when properly installed and coddled, gave you the ability to manipulate other very long strings of ones and zeroes. Even those few who actually understood what a computer operating system was were apt to think of it as a fantastically arcane engineering prodigy, like a breeder reactor or a U-2 spy plane, and not something that could ever be (in the parlance of high-tech) \"productized.\" Yet now the company that Gates and Allen founded is selling operating systems like Gillette sells razor blades. New releases of operating systems are launched as if they were Hollywood blockbusters, with celebrity endorsements, talk show appearances, and world tours. The market for them is vast enough that people worry about whether it has been monopolized by one company. Even the least technically-minded people in our society now have at least a hazy idea of what operating systems do; what is more, they have strong opinions about their relative merits. It is commonly understood, even by technically unsophisticated computer users, that if you have a piece of software that works on your Macintosh, and you move it over onto a Windows machine, it will not run. That this would, in fact, be a laughable and idiotic mistake, like nailing horseshoes to the tires of a Buick. A person who went into a coma before Microsoft was founded, and woke up now, could pick up this morning's New York Times and understand everything in it--almost: Item: the richest man in the world made his fortune from-what? Railways? Shipping? Oil? No, operating systems. Item: the Department of Justice is tackling Microsoft's supposed OS monopoly with legal tools that were invented to restrain the power of Nineteenth-Century robber barons. Item: a woman friend of mine recently told me that she'd broken off a (hitherto) stimulating exchange of e-mail with a young man. At first he had seemed like such an intelligent and interesting guy, she said, but then \"he started going all PC-versus-Mac on me.\" What the hell is going on here? And does the operating system business have a future, or only a past? Here is my view, which is entirely subjective; but since I have spent a fair amount of time not only using, but programming, Macintoshes, Windows machines, Linux boxes and the BeOS, perhaps it is not so ill-informed as to be completely worthless. This is a subjective essay, more review than research paper, and so it might seem unfair or biased compared to the technical reviews you can find in PC magazines. But ever since the Mac came out, our operating systems have been based on metaphors, and anything with metaphors in it is fair game as far as I'm concerned. MGBs, TANKS, AND BATMOBILES Around the time that Jobs, Wozniak, Gates, and Allen were dreaming up these unlikely schemes, I was a teenager living in Ames, Iowa. One of my friends' dads had an old MGB sports car rusting away in his garage. Sometimes he would actually manage to get it running and then he would take us for a spin around the block, with a memorable look of wild youthful exhiliration on his face; to his worried passengers, he was a madman, stalling and backfiring around Ames, Iowa and eating the dust of rusty Gremlins and Pintos, but in his own mind he was Dustin Hoffman tooling across the Bay Bridge with the wind in his hair. In retrospect, this was telling me two things about people's relationship to technology. One was that romance and image go a long way towards shaping their opinions. If you doubt it (and if you have a lot of spare time on your hands) just ask anyone who owns a Macintosh and who, on those grounds, imagines him- or herself to be a member of an oppressed minority group. The other, somewhat subtler point, was that interface is very important. Sure, the MGB was a lousy car in almost every way that counted: balky, unreliable, underpowered. But it was fun to drive. It was responsive. Every pebble on the road was felt in the bones, every nuance in the pavement transmitted instantly to the driver's hands. He could listen to the engine and tell what was wrong with it. The steering responded immediately to commands from his hands. To us passengers it was a pointless exercise in going nowhere--about as interesting as peering over someone's shoulder while he punches numbers into a spreadsheet. But to the driver it was an experience. For a short time he was extending his body and his senses into a larger realm, and doing things that he couldn't do unassisted. The analogy between cars and operating systems is not half bad, and so let me run with it for a moment, as a way of giving an executive summary of our situation today. Imagine a crossroads where four competing auto dealerships are situated. One of them (Microsoft) is much, much bigger than the others. It started out years ago selling three-speed bicycles (MS-DOS); these were not perfect, but they worked, and when they broke you could easily fix them. There was a competing bicycle dealership next door (Apple) that one day began selling motorized vehicles--expensive but attractively styled cars with their innards hermetically sealed, so that how they worked was something of a mystery. The big dealership responded by rushing a moped upgrade kit (the original Windows) onto the market. This was a Rube Goldberg contraption that, when bolted onto a three-speed bicycle, enabled it to keep up, just barely, with Apple-cars. The users had to wear goggles and were always picking bugs out of their teeth while Apple owners sped along in hermetically sealed comfort, sneering out the windows. But the Micro-mopeds were cheap, and easy to fix compared with the Apple-cars, and their market share waxed. Eventually the big dealership came out with a full-fledged car: a colossal station wagon (Windows 95). It had all the aesthetic appeal of a Soviet worker housing block, it leaked oil and blew gaskets, and it was an enormous success. A little later, they also came out with a hulking off-road vehicle intended for industrial users (Windows NT) which was no more beautiful than the station wagon, and only a little more reliable. Since then there has been a lot of noise and shouting, but little has changed. The smaller dealership continues to sell sleek Euro-styled sedans and to spend a lot of money on advertising campaigns. They have had GOING OUT OF BUSINESS! signs taped up in their windows for so long that they have gotten all yellow and curly. The big one keeps making bigger and bigger station wagons and ORVs. On the other side of the road are two competitors that have come along more recently. One of them (Be, Inc.) is selling fully operational Batmobiles (the BeOS). They are more beautiful and stylish even than the Euro-sedans, better designed, more technologically advanced, and at least as reliable as anything else on the market--and yet cheaper than the others. With one exception, that is: Linux, which is right next door, and which is not a business at all. It's a bunch of RVs, yurts, tepees, and geodesic domes set up in a field and organized by consensus. The people who live there are making tanks. These are not old-fashioned, cast-iron Soviet tanks; these are more like the M1 tanks of the U.S. Army, made of space-age materials and jammed with sophisticated technology from one end to the other. But they are better than Army tanks. They've been modified in such a way that they never, ever break down, are light and maneuverable enough to use on ordinary streets, and use no more fuel than a subcompact car. These tanks are being cranked out, on the spot, at a terrific pace, and a vast number of them are lined up along the edge of the road with keys in the ignition. Anyone who wants can simply climb into one and drive it away for free. Customers come to this crossroads in throngs, day and night. Ninety percent of them go straight to the biggest dealership and buy station wagons or off-road vehicles. They do not even look at the other dealerships. Of the remaining ten percent, most go and buy a sleek Euro-sedan, pausing only to turn up their noses at the philistines going to buy the station wagons and ORVs. If they even notice the people on the opposite side of the road, selling the cheaper, technically superior vehicles, these customers deride them cranks and half-wits. The Batmobile outlet sells a few vehicles to the occasional car nut who wants a second vehicle to go with his station wagon, but seems to accept, at least for now, that it's a fringe player. The group giving away the free tanks only stays alive because it is staffed by volunteers, who are lined up at the edge of the street with bullhorns, trying to draw customers' attention to this incredible situation. A typical conversation goes something like this: Hacker with bullhorn: \"Save your money! Accept one of our free tanks! It is invulnerable, and can drive across rocks and swamps at ninety miles an hour while getting a hundred miles to the gallon!\" Prospective station wagon buyer: \"I know what you say is true...but...er...I don't know how to maintain a tank!\" Bullhorn: \"You don't know how to maintain a station wagon either!\" Buyer: \"But this dealership has mechanics on staff. If something goes wrong with my station wagon, I can take a day off work, bring it here, and pay them to work on it while I sit in the waiting room for hours, listening to elevator music.\" Bullhorn: \"But if you accept one of our free tanks we will send volunteers to your house to fix it for free while you sleep!\" Buyer: \"Stay away from my house, you freak!\" Bullhorn: \"But...\" Buyer: \"Can't you see that everyone is buying station wagons?\" BIT-FLINGER The connection between cars, and ways of interacting with computers, wouldn't have occurred to me at the time I was being taken for rides in that MGB. I had signed up to take a computer programming class at Ames High School. After a few introductory lectures, we students were granted admission into a tiny room containing a teletype, a telephone, and an old-fashioned modem consisting of a metal box with a pair of rubber cups on the top (note: many readers, making their way through that last sentence, probably felt an initial pang of dread that this essay was about to turn into a tedious, codgerly reminiscence about how tough we had it back in the old days; rest assured that I am actually positioning my pieces on the chessboard, as it were, in preparation to make a point about truly hip and up-to-the minute topics like Open Source Software). The teletype was exactly the same sort of machine that had been used, for decades, to send and receive telegrams. It was basically a loud typewriter that could only produce UPPERCASE LETTERS. Mounted to one side of it was a smaller machine with a long reel of paper tape on it, and a clear plastic hopper underneath. In order to connect this device (which was not a computer at all) to the Iowa State University mainframe across town, you would pick up the phone, dial the computer's number, listen for strange noises, and then slam the handset down into the rubber cups. If your aim was true, one would wrap its neoprene lips around the earpiece and the other around the mouthpiece, consummating a kind of informational soixante-neuf. The teletype would shudder as it was possessed by the spirit of the distant mainframe, and begin to hammer out cryptic messages. Since computer time was a scarce resource, we used a sort of batch processing technique. Before dialing the phone, we would turn on the tape puncher (a subsidiary machine bolted to the side of the teletype) and type in our programs. Each time we depressed a key, the teletype would bash out a letter on the paper in front of us, so we could read what we'd typed; but at the same time it would convert the letter into a set of eight binary digits, or bits, and punch a corresponding pattern of holes across the width of a paper tape. The tiny disks of paper knocked out of the tape would flutter down into the clear plastic hopper, which would slowly fill up what can only be described as actual bits. On the last day of the school year, the smartest kid in the class (not me) jumped out from behind his desk and flung several quarts of these bits over the head of our teacher, like confetti, as a sort of semi-affectionate practical joke. The image of this man sitting there, gripped in the opening stages of an atavistic fight-or-flight reaction, with millions of bits (megabytes) sifting down out of his hair and into his nostrils and mouth, his face gradually turning purple as he built up to an explosion, is the single most memorable scene from my formal education. Anyway, it will have been obvious that my interaction with the computer was of an extremely formal nature, being sharply divided up into different phases, viz.: (1) sitting at home with paper and pencil, miles and miles from any computer, I would think very, very hard about what I wanted the computer to do, and translate my intentions into a computer language--a series of alphanumeric symbols on a page. (2) I would carry this across a sort of informational cordon sanitaire (three miles of snowdrifts) to school and type those letters into a machine--not a computer--which would convert the symbols into binary numbers and record them visibly on a tape. (3) Then, through the rubber-cup modem, I would cause those numbers to be sent to the university mainframe, which would (4) do arithmetic on them and send different numbers back to the teletype. (5) The teletype would convert these numbers back into letters and hammer them out on a page and (6) I, watching, would construe the letters as meaningful symbols. The division of responsibilities implied by all of this is admirably clean: computers do arithmetic on bits of information. Humans construe the bits as meaningful symbols. But this distinction is now being blurred, or at least complicated, by the advent of modern operating systems that use, and frequently abuse, the power of metaphor to make computers accessible to a larger audience. Along the way--possibly because of those metaphors, which make an operating system a sort of work of art--people start to get emotional, and grow attached to pieces of software in the way that my friend's dad did to his MGB. People who have only interacted with computers through graphical user interfaces like the MacOS or Windows--which is to say, almost everyone who has ever used a computer--may have been startled, or at least bemused, to hear about the telegraph machine that I used to communicate with a computer in 1973. But there was, and is, a good reason for using this particular kind of technology. Human beings have various ways of communicating to each other, such as music, art, dance, and facial expressions, but some of these are more amenable than others to being expressed as strings of symbols. Written language is the easiest of all, because, of course, it consists of strings of symbols to begin with. If the symbols happen to belong to a phonetic alphabet (as opposed to, say, ideograms), converting them into bits is a trivial procedure, and one that was nailed, technologically, in the early nineteenth century, with the introduction of Morse code and other forms of telegraphy. We had a human/computer interface a hundred years before we had computers. When computers came into being around the time of the Second World War, humans, quite naturally, communicated with them by simply grafting them on to the already-existing technologies for translating letters into bits and vice versa: teletypes and punch card machines. These embodied two fundamentally different approaches to computing. When you were using cards, you'd punch a whole stack of them and run them through the reader all at once, which was called batch processing. You could also do batch processing with a teletype, as I have already described, by using the paper tape reader, and we were certainly encouraged to use this approach when I was in high school. But--though efforts were made to keep us unaware of this--the teletype could do something that the card reader could not. On the teletype, once the modem link was established, you could just type in a line and hit the return key. The teletype would send that line to the computer, which might or might not respond with some lines of its own, which the teletype would hammer out--producing, over time, a transcript of your exchange with the machine. This way of doing it did not even have a name at the time, but when, much later, an alternative became available, it was retroactively dubbed the Command Line Interface. When I moved on to college, I did my computing in large, stifling rooms where scores of students would sit in front of slightly updated versions of the same machines and write computer programs: these used dot-matrix printing mechanisms, but were (from the computer's point of view) identical to the old teletypes. By that point, computers were better at time-sharing--that is, mainframes were still mainframes, but they were better at communicating with a large number of terminals at once. Consequently, it was no longer necessary to use batch processing. Card readers were shoved out into hallways and boiler rooms, and batch processing became a nerds-only kind of thing, and consequently took on a certain eldritch flavor among those of us who even knew it existed. We were all off the Batch, and on the Command Line, interface now--my very first shift in operating system paradigms, if only I'd known it. A huge stack of accordion-fold paper sat on the floor underneath each one of these glorified teletypes, and miles of paper shuddered through their platens. Almost all of this paper was thrown away or recycled without ever having been touched by ink--an ecological atrocity so glaring that those machines soon replaced by video terminals--so-called \"glass teletypes\"--which were quieter and didn't waste paper. Again, though, from the computer's point of view these were indistinguishable from World War II-era teletype machines. In effect we still used Victorian technology to communicate with computers until about 1984, when the Macintosh was introduced with its Graphical User Interface. Even after that, the Command Line continued to exist as an underlying stratum--a sort of brainstem reflex--of many modern computer systems all through the heyday of Graphical User Interfaces, or GUIs as I will call them from now on. GUIs Now the first job that any coder needs to do when writing a new piece of software is to figure out how to take the information that is being worked with (in a graphics program, an image; in a spreadsheet, a grid of numbers) and turn it into a linear string of bytes. These strings of bytes are commonly called files or (somewhat more hiply) streams. They are to telegrams what modern humans are to Cro-Magnon man, which is to say the same thing under a different name. All that you see on your computer screen--your Tomb Raider, your digitized voice mail messages, faxes, and word processing documents written in thirty-seven different typefaces--is still, from the computer's point of view, just like telegrams, except much longer, and demanding of more arithmetic. The quickest way to get a taste of this is to fire up your web browser, visit a site, and then select the View/Document Source menu item. You will get a bunch of computer code that looks something like this: C R Y P T O N O M I C O N      \n\nThis crud is called HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and it is basically a very simple programming language instructing your web browser how to draw a page on a screen. Anyone can learn HTML and many people do. The important thing is that no matter what splendid multimedia web pages they might represent, HTML files are just telegrams. When Ronald Reagan was a radio announcer, he used to call baseball games by reading the terse descriptions that trickled in over the telegraph wire and were printed out on a paper tape. He would sit there, all by himself in a padded room with a microphone, and the paper tape would eke out of the machine and crawl over the palm of his hand printed with cryptic abbreviations. If the count went to three and two, Reagan would describe the scene as he saw it in his mind's eye: \"The brawny left-hander steps out of the batter's box to wipe the sweat from his brow. The umpire steps forward to sweep the dirt from home plate.\" and so on. When the cryptogram on the paper tape announced a base hit, he would whack the edge of the table with a pencil, creating a little sound effect, and describe the arc of the ball as if he could actually see it. His listeners, many of whom presumably thought that Reagan was actually at the ballpark watching the game, would reconstruct the scene in their minds according to his descriptions. This is exactly how the World Wide Web works: the HTML files are the pithy description on the paper tape, and your Web browser is Ronald Reagan. The same is true of Graphical User Interfaces in general. So an OS is a stack of metaphors and abstractions that stands between you and the telegrams, and embodying various tricks the programmer used to convert the information you're working with--be it images, e-mail messages, movies, or word processing documents--into the necklaces of bytes that are the only things computers know how to work with. When we used actual telegraph equipment (teletypes) or their higher-tech substitutes (\"glass teletypes,\" or the MS-DOS command line) to work with our computers, we were very close to the bottom of that stack. When we use most modern operating systems, though, our interaction with the machine is heavily mediated. Everything we do is interpreted and translated time and again as it works its way down through all of the metaphors and abstractions. The Macintosh OS was a revolution in both the good and bad senses of that word. Obviously it was true that command line interfaces were not for everyone, and that it would be a good thing to make computers more accessible to a less technical audience--if not for altruistic reasons, then because those sorts of people constituted an incomparably vaster market. It was clear the the Mac's engineers saw a whole new country stretching out before them; you could almost hear them muttering, \"Wow! We don't have to be bound by files as linear streams of bytes anymore, vive la revolution, let's see how far we can take this!\" No command line interface was available on the Macintosh; you talked to it with the mouse, or not at all. This was a statement of sorts, a credential of revolutionary purity. It seemed that the designers of the Mac intended to sweep Command Line Interfaces into the dustbin of history. My own personal love affair with the Macintosh began in the spring of 1984 in a computer store in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, when a friend of mine--coincidentally, the son of the MGB owner--showed me a Macintosh running MacPaint, the revolutionary drawing program. It ended in July of 1995 when I tried to save a big important file on my Macintosh Powerbook and instead instead of doing so, it annihilated the data so thoroughly that two different disk crash utility programs were unable to find any trace that it had ever existed. During the intervening ten years, I had a passion for the MacOS that seemed righteous and reasonable at the time but in retrospect strikes me as being exactly the same sort of goofy infatuation that my friend's dad had with his car. The introduction of the Mac triggered a sort of holy war in the computer world. Were GUIs a brilliant design innovation that made computers more human-centered and therefore accessible to the masses, leading us toward an unprecedented revolution in human society, or an insulting bit of audiovisual gimcrackery dreamed up by flaky Bay Area hacker types that stripped computers of their power and flexibility and turned the noble and serious work of computing into a childish video game? This debate actually seems more interesting to me today than it did in the mid-1980s. But people more or less stopped debating it when Microsoft endorsed the idea of GUIs by coming out with the first Windows. At this point, command-line partisans were relegated to the status of silly old grouches, and a new conflict was touched off, between users of MacOS and users of Windows. There was plenty to argue about. The first Macintoshes looked different from other PCs even when they were turned off: they consisted of one box containing both CPU (the part of the computer that does arithmetic on bits) and monitor screen. This was billed, at the time, as a philosophical statement of sorts: Apple wanted to make the personal computer into an appliance, like a toaster. But it also reflected the purely technical demands of running a graphical user interface. In a GUI machine, the chips that draw things on the screen have to be integrated with the computer's central processing unit, or CPU, to a far greater extent than is the case with command-line interfaces, which until recently didn't even know that they weren't just talking to teletypes. This distinction was of a technical and abstract nature, but it became clearer when the machine crashed (it is commonly the case with technologies that you can get the best insight about how they work by watching them fail). When everything went to hell and the CPU began spewing out random bits, the result, on a CLI machine, was lines and lines of perfectly formed but random characters on the screen--known to cognoscenti as \"going Cyrillic.\" But to the MacOS, the screen was not a teletype, but a place to put graphics; the image on the screen was a bitmap, a literal rendering of the contents of a particular portion of the computer's memory. When the computer crashed and wrote gibberish into the bitmap, the result was something that looked vaguely like static on a broken television set--a \"snow crash.\" And even after the introduction of Windows, the underlying differences endured; when a Windows machine got into trouble, the old command-line interface would fall down over the GUI like an asbestos fire curtain sealing off the proscenium of a burning opera. When a Macintosh got into trouble it presented you with a cartoon of a bomb, which was funny the first time you saw it. And these were by no means superficial differences. The reversion of Windows to a CLI when it was in distress proved to Mac partisans that Windows was nothing more than a cheap facade, like a garish afghan flung over a rotted-out sofa. They were disturbed and annoyed by the sense that lurking underneath Windows' ostensibly user-friendly interface was--literally--a subtext. For their part, Windows fans might have made the sour observation that all computers, even Macintoshes, were built on that same subtext, and that the refusal of Mac owners to admit that fact to themselves seemed to signal a willingness, almost an eagerness, to be duped. Anyway, a Macintosh had to switch individual bits in the memory chips on the video card, and it had to do it very fast, and in arbitrarily complicated patterns. Nowadays this is cheap and easy, but in the technological regime that prevailed in the early 1980s, the only realistic way to do it was to build the motherboard (which contained the CPU) and the video system (which contained the memory that was mapped onto the screen) as a tightly integrated whole--hence the single, hermetically sealed case that made the Macintosh so distinctive. When Windows came out, it was conspicuous for its ugliness, and its current successors, Windows 95 and Windows NT, are not things that people would pay money to look at either. Microsoft's complete disregard for aesthetics gave all of us Mac-lovers plenty of opportunities to look down our noses at them. That Windows looked an awful lot like a direct ripoff of MacOS gave us a burning sense of moral outrage to go with it. Among people who really knew and appreciated computers (hackers, in Steven Levy's non-pejorative sense of that word) and in a few other niches such as professional musicians, graphic artists and schoolteachers, the Macintosh, for a while, was simply the computer. It was seen as not only a superb piece of engineering, but an embodiment of certain ideals about the use of technology to benefit mankind, while Windows was seen as a pathetically clumsy imitation and a sinister world domination plot rolled into one. So very early, a pattern had been established that endures to this day: people dislike Microsoft, which is okay; but they dislike it for reasons that are poorly considered, and in the end, self-defeating. CLASS STRUGGLE ON THE DESKTOP Now that the Third Rail has been firmly grasped, it is worth reviewing some basic facts here: like any other publicly traded, for-profit corporation, Microsoft has, in effect, borrowed a bunch of money from some people (its stockholders) in order to be in the bit business. As an officer of that corporation, Bill Gates has one responsibility only, which is to maximize return on investment. He has done this incredibly well. Any actions taken in the world by Microsoft-any software released by them, for example--are basically epiphenomena, which can't be interpreted or understood except insofar as they reflect Bill Gates's execution of his one and only responsibility. It follows that if Microsoft sells goods that are aesthetically unappealing, or that don't work very well, it does not mean that they are (respectively) philistines or half-wits. It is because Microsoft's excellent management has figured out that they can make more money for their stockholders by releasing stuff with obvious, known imperfections than they can by making it beautiful or bug-free. This is annoying, but (in the end) not half so annoying as watching Apple inscrutably and relentlessly destroy itself. Hostility towards Microsoft is not difficult to find on the Net, and it blends two strains: resentful people who feel Microsoft is too powerful, and disdainful people who think it's tacky. This is all strongly reminiscent of the heyday of Communism and Socialism, when the bourgeoisie were hated from both ends: by the proles, because they had all the money, and by the intelligentsia, because of their tendency to spend it on lawn ornaments. Microsoft is the very embodiment of modern high-tech prosperity--it is, in a word, bourgeois--and so it attracts all of the same gripes. The opening \"splash screen\" for Microsoft Word 6.0 summed it up pretty neatly: when you started up the program you were treated to a picture of an expensive enamel pen lying across a couple of sheets of fancy-looking handmade writing paper. It was obviously a bid to make the software look classy, and it might have worked for some, but it failed for me, because the pen was a ballpoint, and I'm a fountain pen man. If Apple had done it, they would've used a Mont Blanc fountain pen, or maybe a Chinese calligraphy brush. And I doubt that this was an accident. Recently I spent a while re-installing Windows NT on one of my home computers, and many times had to double-click on the \"Control Panel\" icon. For reasons that are difficult to fathom, this icon consists of a picture of a clawhammer and a chisel or screwdriver resting on top of a file folder. These aesthetic gaffes give one an almost uncontrollable urge to make fun of Microsoft, but again, it is all beside the point--if Microsoft had done focus group testing of possible alternative graphics, they probably would have found that the average mid-level office worker associated fountain pens with effete upper management toffs and was more comfortable with ballpoints. Likewise, the regular guys, the balding dads of the world who probably bear the brunt of setting up and maintaining home computers, can probably relate better to a picture of a clawhammer--while perhaps harboring fantasies of taking a real one to their balky computers. This is the only way I can explain certain peculiar facts about the current market for operating systems, such as that ninety percent of all customers continue to buy station wagons off the Microsoft lot while free tanks are there for the taking, right across the street. A string of ones and zeroes was not a difficult thing for Bill Gates to distribute, one he'd thought of the idea. The hard part was selling it--reassuring customers that they were actually getting something in return for their money. Anyone who has ever bought a piece of software in a store has had the curiously deflating experience of taking the bright shrink-wrapped box home, tearing it open, finding that it's 95 percent air, throwing away all the little cards, party favors, and bits of trash, and loading the disk into the computer. The end result (after you've lost the disk) is nothing except some images on a computer screen, and some capabilities that weren't there before. Sometimes you don't even have that--you have a string of error messages instead. But your money is definitely gone. Now we are almost accustomed to this, but twenty years ago it was a very dicey business proposition. Bill Gates made it work anyway. He didn't make it work by selling the best software or offering the cheapest price. Instead he somehow got people to believe that they were receiving something in exchange for their money. The streets of every city in the world are filled with those hulking, rattling station wagons. Anyone who doesn't own one feels a little weird, and wonders, in spite of himself, whether it might not be time to cease resistance and buy one; anyone who does, feels confident that he has acquired some meaningful possession, even on those days when the vehicle is up on a lift in an auto repair shop. All of this is perfectly congruent with membership in the bourgeoisie, which is as much a mental, as a material state. And it explains why Microsoft is regularly attacked, on the Net, from both sides. People who are inclined to feel poor and oppressed construe everything Microsoft does as some sinister Orwellian plot. People who like to think of themselves as intelligent and informed technology users are driven crazy by the clunkiness of Windows. Nothing is more annoying to sophisticated people to see someone who is rich enough to know better being tacky--unless it is to realize, a moment later, that they probably know they are tacky and they simply don't care and they are going to go on being tacky, and rich, and happy, forever. Microsoft therefore bears the same relationship to the Silicon Valley elite as the Beverly Hillbillies did to their fussy banker, Mr. Drysdale--who is irritated not so much by the fact that the Clampetts moved to his neighborhood as by the knowledge that, when Jethro is seventy years old, he's still going to be talking like a hillbilly and wearing bib overalls, and he's still going to be a lot richer than Mr. Drysdale. Even the hardware that Windows ran on, when compared to the machines put out by Apple, looked like white-trash stuff, and still mostly does. The reason was that Apple was and is a hardware company, while Microsoft was and is a software company. Apple therefore had a monopoly on hardware that could run MacOS, whereas Windows-compatible hardware came out of a free market. The free market seems to have decided that people will not pay for cool-looking computers; PC hardware makers who hire designers to make their stuff look distinctive get their clocks cleaned by Taiwanese clone makers punching out boxes that look as if they belong on cinderblocks in front of someone's trailer. But Apple could make their hardware as pretty as they wanted to and simply pass the higher prices on to their besotted consumers, like me. Only last week (I am writing this sentence in early Jan. 1999) the technology sections of all the newspapers were filled with adulatory press coverage of how Apple had released the iMac in several happenin' new colors like Blueberry and Tangerine. Apple has always insisted on having a hardware monopoly, except for a brief period in the mid-1990s when they allowed clone-makers to compete with them, before subsequently putting them out of business. Macintosh hardware was, consequently, expensive. You didn't open it up and fool around with it because doing so would void the warranty. In fact the first Mac was specifically designed to be difficult to open--you needed a kit of exotic tools, which you could buy through little ads that began to appear in the back pages of magazines a few months after the Mac came out on the market. These ads always had a certain disreputable air about them, like pitches for lock-picking tools in the backs of lurid detective magazines. This monopolistic policy can be explained in at least three different ways. THE CHARITABLE EXPLANATION is that the hardware monopoly policy reflected a drive on Apple's part to provide a seamless, unified blending of hardware, operating system, and software. There is something to this. It is hard enough to make an OS that works well on one specific piece of hardware, designed and tested by engineers who work down the hallway from you, in the same company. Making an OS to work on arbitrary pieces of hardware, cranked out by rabidly entrepeneurial clonemakers on the other side of the International Date Line, is very difficult, and accounts for much of the troubles people have using Windows. THE FINANCIAL EXPLANATION is that Apple, unlike Microsoft, is and always has been a hardware company. It simply depends on revenue from selling hardware, and cannot exist without it. THE NOT-SO-CHARITABLE EXPLANATION has to do with Apple's corporate culture, which is rooted in Bay Area Baby Boomdom. Now, since I'm going to talk for a moment about culture, full disclosure is probably in order, to protect myself against allegations of conflict of interest and ethical turpitude: (1) Geographically I am a Seattleite, of a Saturnine temperament, and inclined to take a sour view of the Dionysian Bay Area, just as they tend to be annoyed and appalled by us. (2) Chronologically I am a post-Baby Boomer. I feel that way, at least, because I never experienced the fun and exciting parts of the whole Boomer scene--just spent a lot of time dutifully chuckling at Boomers' maddeningly pointless anecdotes about just how stoned they got on various occasions, and politely fielding their assertions about how great their music was. But even from this remove it was possible to glean certain patterns, and one that recurred as regularly as an urban legend was the one about how someone would move into a commune populated by sandal-wearing, peace-sign flashing flower children, and eventually discover that, underneath this facade, the guys who ran it were actually control freaks; and that, as living in a commune, where much lip service was paid to ideals of peace, love and harmony, had deprived them of normal, socially approved outlets for their control-freakdom, it tended to come out in other, invariably more sinister, ways. Applying this to the case of Apple Computer will be left as an exercise for the reader, and not a very difficult exercise. It is a bit unsettling, at first, to think of Apple as a control freak, because it is completely at odds with their corporate image. Weren't these the guys who aired the famous Super Bowl ads showing suited, blindfolded executives marching like lemmings off a cliff? Isn't this the company that even now runs ads picturing the Dalai Lama (except in Hong Kong) and Einstein and other offbeat rebels? It is indeed the same company, and the fact that they have been able to plant this image of themselves as creative and rebellious free-thinkers in the minds of so many intelligent and media-hardened skeptics really gives one pause. It is testimony to the insidious power of expensive slick ad campaigns and, perhaps, to a certain amount of wishful thinking in the minds of people who fall for them. It also raises the question of why Microsoft is so bad at PR, when the history of Apple demonstrates that, by writing large checks to good ad agencies, you can plant a corporate image in the minds of intelligent people that is completely at odds with reality. (The answer, for people who don't like Damoclean questions, is that since Microsoft has won the hearts and minds of the silent majority--the bourgeoisie--they don't give a damn about having a slick image, any more then Dick Nixon did. \"I want to believe,\"--the mantra that Fox Mulder has pinned to his office wall in The X-Files--applies in different ways to these two companies; Mac partisans want to believe in the image of Apple purveyed in those ads, and in the notion that Macs are somehow fundamentally different from other computers, while Windows people want to believe that they are getting something for their money, engaging in a respectable business transaction). In any event, as of 1987, both MacOS and Windows were out on the market, running on hardware platforms that were radically different from each other--not only in the sense that MacOS used Motorola CPU chips while Windows used Intel, but in the sense--then overlooked, but in the long run, vastly more significant--that the Apple hardware business was a rigid monopoly and the Windows side was a churning free-for-all. But the full ramifications of this did not become clear until very recently--in fact, they are still unfolding, in remarkably strange ways, as I'll explain when we get to Linux. The upshot is that millions of people got accustomed to using GUIs in one form or another. By doing so, they made Apple/Microsoft a lot of money. The fortunes of many people have become bound up with the ability of these companies to continue selling products whose salability is very much open to question. HONEY-POT, TAR-PIT, WHATEVER When Gates and Allen invented the idea of selling software, they ran into criticism from both hackers and sober-sided businesspeople. Hackers understood that software was just information, and objected to the idea of selling it. These objections were partly moral. The hackers were coming out of the scientific and academic world where it is imperative to make the results of one's work freely available to the public. They were also partly practical; how can you sell something that can be easily copied? Businesspeople, who are polar opposites of hackers in so many ways, had objections of their own. Accustomed to selling toasters and insurance policies, they naturally had a difficult time understanding how a long collection of ones and zeroes could constitute a salable product. Obviously Microsoft prevailed over these objections, and so did Apple. But the objections still exist. The most hackerish of all the hackers, the Ur-hacker as it were, was and is Richard Stallman, who became so annoyed with the evil practice of selling software that, in 1984 (the same year that the Macintosh went on sale) he went off and founded something called the Free Software Foundation, which commenced work on something called GNU. Gnu is an acronym for Gnu's Not Unix, but this is a joke in more ways than one, because GNU most certainly IS Unix,. Because of trademark concerns (\"Unix\" is trademarked by AT&T) they simply could not claim that it was Unix, and so, just to be extra safe, they claimed that it wasn't. Notwithstanding the incomparable talent and drive possessed by Mr. Stallman and other GNU adherents, their project to build a free Unix to compete against Microsoft and Apple's OSes was a little bit like trying to dig a subway system with a teaspoon. Until, that is, the advent of Linux, which I will get to later. But the basic idea of re-creating an operating system from scratch was perfectly sound and completely doable. It has been done many times. It is inherent in the very nature of operating systems. Operating systems are not strictly necessary. There is no reason why a sufficiently dedicated coder could not start from nothing with every project and write fresh code to handle such basic, low-level operations as controlling the read/write heads on the disk drives and lighting up pixels on the screen. The very first computers had to be programmed in this way. But since nearly every program needs to carry out those same basic operations, this approach would lead to vast duplication of effort. Nothing is more disagreeable to the hacker than duplication of effort. The first and most important mental habit that people develop when they learn how to write computer programs is to generalize, generalize, generalize. To make their code as modular and flexible as possible, breaking large problems down into small subroutines that can be used over and over again in different contexts. Consequently, the development of operating systems, despite being technically unnecessary, was inevitable. Because at its heart, an operating system is nothing more than a library containing the most commonly used code, written once (and hopefully written well) and then made available to every coder who needs it. So a proprietary, closed, secret operating system is a contradiction in terms. It goes against the whole point of having an operating system. And it is impossible to keep them secret anyway. The source code--the original lines of text written by the programmers--can be kept secret. But an OS as a whole is a collection of small subroutines that do very specific, very clearly defined jobs. Exactly what those subroutines do has to be made public, quite explicitly and exactly, or else the OS is completely useless to programmers; they can't make use of those subroutines if they don't have a complete and perfect understanding of what the subroutines do. The only thing that isn't made public is exactly how the subroutines do what they do. But once you know what a subroutine does, it's generally quite easy (if you are a hacker) to write one of your own that does exactly the same thing. It might take a while, and it is tedious and unrewarding, but in most cases it's not really hard. What's hard, in hacking as in fiction, is not writing; it's deciding what to write. And the vendors of commercial OSes have already decided, and published their decisions. This has been generally understood for a long time. MS-DOS was duplicated, functionally, by a rival product, written from scratch, called ProDOS, that did all of the same things in pretty much the same way. In other words, another company was able to write code that did all of the same things as MS-DOS and sell it at a profit. If you are using the Linux OS, you can get a free program called WINE which is a windows emulator; that is, you can open up a window on your desktop that runs windows programs. It means that a completely functional Windows OS has been recreated inside of Unix, like a ship in a bottle. And Unix itself, which is vastly more sophisticated than MS-DOS, has been built up from scratch many times over. Versions of it are sold by Sun, Hewlett-Packard, AT&T, Silicon Graphics, IBM, and others. People have, in other words, been re-writing basic OS code for so long that all of the technology that constituted an \"operating system\" in the traditional (pre-GUI) sense of that phrase is now so cheap and common that it's literally free. Not only could Gates and Allen not sell MS-DOS today, they could not even give it away, because much more powerful OSes are already being given away. Even the original Windows (which was the only windows until 1995) has become worthless, in that there is no point in owning something that can be emulated inside of Linux--which is, itself, free. In this way the OS business is very different from, say, the car business. Even an old rundown car has some value. You can use it for making runs to the dump, or strip it for parts. It is the fate of manufactured goods to slowly and gently depreciate as they get old and have to compete against more modern products. But it is the fate of operating systems to become free. Microsoft is a great software applications company. Applications--such as Microsoft Word--are an area where innovation brings real, direct, tangible benefits to users. The innovations might be new technology straight from the research department, or they might be in the category of bells and whistles, but in any event they are frequently useful and they seem to make users happy. And Microsoft is in the process of becoming a great research company. But Microsoft is not such a great operating systems company. And this is not necessarily because their operating systems are all that bad from a purely technological standpoint. Microsoft's OSes do have their problems, sure, but they are vastly better than they used to be, and they are adequate for most people. Why, then, do I say that Microsoft is not such a great operating systems company? Because the very nature of operating systems is such that it is senseless for them to be developed and owned by a specific company. It's a thankless job to begin with. Applications create possibilities for millions of credulous users, whereas OSes impose limitations on thousands of grumpy coders, and so OS-makers will forever be on the shit-list of anyone who counts for anything in the high-tech world. Applications get used by people whose big problem is understanding all of their features, whereas OSes get hacked by coders who are annoyed by their limitations. The OS business has been good to Microsoft only insofar as it has given them the money they needed to launch a really good applications software business and to hire a lot of smart researchers. Now it really ought to be jettisoned, like a spent booster stage from a rocket. The big question is whether Microsoft is capable of doing this. Or is it addicted to OS sales in the same way as Apple is to selling hardware? Keep in mind that Apple's ability to monopolize its own hardware supply was once cited, by learned observers, as a great advantage over Microsoft. At the time, it seemed to place them in a much stronger position. In the end, it nearly killed them, and may kill them yet. The problem, for Apple, was that most of the world's computer users ended up owning cheaper hardware. But cheap hardware couldn't run MacOS, and so these people switched to Windows. Replace \"hardware\" with \"operating systems,\" and \"Apple\" with \"Microsoft\" and you can see the same thing about to happen all over again. Microsoft dominates the OS market, which makes them money and seems like a great idea for now. But cheaper and better OSes are available, and they are growingly popular in parts of the world that are not so saturated with computers as the US. Ten years from now, most of the world's computer users may end up owning these cheaper OSes. But these OSes do not, for the time being, run any Microsoft applications, and so these people will use something else. To put it more directly: every time someone decides to use a non-Microsoft OS, Microsoft's OS division, obviously, loses a customer. But, as things stand now, Microsoft's applications division loses a customer too. This is not such a big deal as long as almost everyone uses Microsoft OSes. But as soon as Windows' market share begins to slip, the math starts to look pretty dismal for the people in Redmond. This argument could be countered by saying that Microsoft could simply re-compile its applications to run under other OSes. But this strategy goes against most normal corporate instincts. Again the case of Apple is instructive. When things started to go south for Apple, they should have ported their OS to cheap PC hardware. But they didn't. Instead, they tried to make the most of their brilliant hardware, adding new features and expanding the product line. But this only had the effect of making their OS more dependent on these special hardware features, which made it worse for them in the end. Likewise, when Microsoft's position in the OS world is threatened, their corporate instincts will tell them to pile more new features into their operating systems, and then re-jigger their software applications to exploit those special features. But this will only have the effect of making their applications dependent on an OS with declining market share, and make it worse for them in the end. The operating system market is a death-trap, a tar-pit, a slough of despond. There are only two reasons to invest in Apple and Microsoft. (1) each of these companies is in what we would call a co-dependency relationship with their customers. The customers Want To Believe, and Apple and Microsoft know how to give them what they want. (2) each company works very hard to add new features to their OSes, which works to secure customer loyalty, at least for a little while. Accordingly, most of the remainder of this essay will be about those two topics. THE TECHNOSPHERE Unix is the only OS remaining whose GUI (a vast suite of code called the X Windows System) is separate from the OS in the old sense of the phrase. This is to say that you can run Unix in pure command-line mode if you want to, with no windows, icons, mouses, etc. whatsoever, and it will still be Unix and capable of doing everything Unix is supposed to do. But the other OSes: MacOS, the Windows family, and BeOS, have their GUIs tangled up with the old-fashioned OS functions to the extent that they have to run in GUI mode, or else they are not really running. So it's no longer really possible to think of GUIs as being distinct from the OS; they're now an inextricable part of the OSes that they belong to--and they are by far the largest part, and by far the most expensive and difficult part to create. There are only two ways to sell a product: price and features. When OSes are free, OS companies cannot compete on price, and so they compete on features. This means that they are always trying to outdo each other writing code that, until recently, was not considered to be part of an OS at all: stuff like GUIs. This explains a lot about how these companies behave. It explains why Microsoft added a browser to their OS, for example. It is easy to get free browsers, just as to get free OSes. If browsers are free, and OSes are free, it would seem that there is no way to make money from browsers or OSes. But if you can integrate a browser into the OS and thereby imbue both of them with new features, you have a salable product. Setting aside, for the moment, the fact that this makes government anti-trust lawyers really mad, this strategy makes sense. At least, it makes sense if you assume (as Microsoft's management appears to) that the OS has to be protected at all costs. The real question is whether every new technological trend that comes down the pike ought to be used as a crutch to maintain the OS's dominant position. Confronted with the Web phenomenon, Microsoft had to develop a really good web browser, and they did. But then they had a choice: they could have made that browser work on many different OSes, which would give Microsoft a strong position in the Internet world no matter what happened to their OS market share. Or they could make the browser one with the OS, gambling that this would make the OS look so modern and sexy that it would help to preserve their dominance in that market. The problem is that when Microsoft's OS position begins to erode (and since it is currently at something like ninety percent, it can't go anywhere but down) it will drag everything else down with it. In your high school geology class you probably were taught that all life on earth exists in a paper-thin shell called the biosphere, which is trapped between thousands of miles of dead rock underfoot, and cold dead radioactive empty space above. Companies that sell OSes exist in a sort of technosphere. Underneath is technology that has already become free. Above is technology that has yet to be developed, or that is too crazy and speculative to be productized just yet. Like the Earth's biosphere, the technosphere is very thin compared to what is above and what is below. But it moves a lot faster. In various parts of our world, it is possible to go and visit rich fossil beds where skeleton lies piled upon skeleton, recent ones on top and more ancient ones below. In theory they go all the way back to the first single-celled organisms. And if you use your imagination a bit, you can understand that, if you hang around long enough, you'll become fossilized there too, and in time some more advanced organism will become fossilized on top of you. The fossil record--the La Brea Tar Pit--of software technology is the Internet. Anything that shows up there is free for the taking (possibly illegal, but free). Executives at companies like Microsoft must get used to the experience--unthinkable in other industries--of throwing millions of dollars into the development of new technologies, such as Web browsers, and then seeing the same or equivalent software show up on the Internet two years, or a year, or even just a few months, later. By continuing to develop new technologies and add features onto their products they can keep one step ahead of the fossilization process, but on certain days they must feel like mammoths caught at La Brea, using all their energies to pull their feet, over and over again, out of the sucking hot tar that wants to cover and envelop them. Survival in this biosphere demands sharp tusks and heavy, stomping feet at one end of the organization, and Microsoft famously has those. But trampling the other mammoths into the tar can only keep you alive for so long. The danger is that in their obsession with staying out of the fossil beds, these companies will forget about what lies above the biosphere: the realm of new technology. In other words, they must hang onto their primitive weapons and crude competitive instincts, but also evolve powerful brains. This appears to be what Microsoft is doing with its research division, which has been hiring smart people right and left (Here I should mention that although I know, and socialize with, several people in that company's research division, we never talk about business issues and I have little to no idea what the hell they are up to. I have learned much more about Microsoft by using the Linux operating system than I ever would have done by using Windows). Never mind how Microsoft used to make money; today, it is making its money on a kind of temporal arbitrage. \"Arbitrage,\" in the usual sense, means to make money by taking advantage of differences in the price of something between different markets. It is spatial, in other words, and hinges on the arbitrageur knowing what is going on simultaneously in different places. Microsoft is making money by taking advantage of differences in the price of technology in different times. Temporal arbitrage, if I may coin a phrase, hinges on the arbitrageur knowing what technologies people will pay money for next year, and how soon afterwards those same technologies will become free. What spatial and temporal arbitrage have in common is that both hinge on the arbitrageur's being extremely well-informed; one about price gradients across space at a given time, and the other about price gradients over time in a given place. So Apple/Microsoft shower new features upon their users almost daily, in the hopes that a steady stream of genuine technical innovations, combined with the \"I want to believe\" phenomenon, will prevent their customers from looking across the road towards the cheaper and better OSes that are available to them. The question is whether this makes sense in the long run. If Microsoft is addicted to OSes as Apple is to hardware, then they will bet the whole farm on their OSes, and tie all of their new applications and technologies to them. Their continued survival will then depend on these two things: adding more features to their OSes so that customers will not switch to the cheaper alternatives, and maintaining the image that, in some mysterious way, gives those customers the feeling that they are getting something for their money. The latter is a truly strange and interesting cultural phenomenon. THE INTERFACE CULTURE A few years ago I walked into a grocery store somewhere and was presented with the following tableau vivant: near the entrance a young couple were standing in front of a large cosmetics display. The man was stolidly holding a shopping basket between his hands while his mate raked blister-packs of makeup off the display and piled them in. Since then I've always thought of that man as the personification of an interesting human tendency: not only are we not offended to be dazzled by manufactured images, but we like it. We practically insist on it. We are eager to be complicit in our own dazzlement: to pay money for a theme park ride, vote for a guy who's obviously lying to us, or stand there holding the basket as it's filled up with cosmetics. I was in Disney World recently, specifically the part of it called the Magic Kingdom, walking up Main Street USA. This is a perfect gingerbready Victorian small town that culminates in a Disney castle. It was very crowded; we shuffled rather than walked. Directly in front of me was a man with a camcorder. It was one of the new breed of camcorders where instead of peering through a viewfinder you gaze at a flat-panel color screen about the size of a playing card, which televises live coverage of whatever the camcorder is seeing. He was holding the appliance close to his face, so that it obstructed his view. Rather than go see a real small town for free, he had paid money to see a pretend one, and rather than see it with the naked eye he was watching it on television. And rather than stay home and read a book, I was watching him. Americans' preference for mediated experiences is obvious enough, and I'm not going to keep pounding it into the ground. I'm not even going to make snotty comments about it--after all, I was at Disney World as a paying customer. But it clearly relates to the colossal success of GUIs and so I have to talk about it some. Disney does mediated experiences better than anyone. If they understood what OSes are, and why people use them, they could crush Microsoft in a year or two. In the part of Disney World called the Animal Kingdom there is a new attraction, slated to open in March 1999, called the Maharajah Jungle Trek. It was open for sneak previews when I was there. This is a complete stone-by-stone reproduction of a hypothetical ruin in the jungles of India. According to its backstory, it was built by a local rajah in the 16th Century as a game reserve. He would go there with his princely guests to hunt Bengal tigers. As time went on it fell into disrepair and the tigers and monkeys took it over; eventually, around the time of India's independence, it became a government wildlife reserve, now open to visitors. The place looks more like what I have just described than any actual building you might find in India. All the stones in the broken walls are weathered as if monsoon rains had been trickling down them for centuries, the paint on the gorgeous murals is flaked and faded just so, and Bengal tigers loll amid stumps of broken columns. Where modern repairs have been made to the ancient structure, they've been done, not as Disney's engineers would do them, but as thrifty Indian janitors would--with hunks of bamboo and rust-spotted hunks of rebar. The rust is painted on, or course, and protected from real rust by a plastic clear-coat, but you can't tell unless you get down on your knees. In one place you walk along a stone wall with a series of old pitted friezes carved into it. One end of the wall has broken off and settled into the earth, perhaps because of some long-forgotten earthquake, and so a broad jagged crack runs across a panel or two, but the story is still readable: first, primordial chaos leads to a flourishing of many animal species. Next, we see the Tree of Life surrounded by diverse animals. This is an obvious allusion (or, in showbiz lingo, a tie-in) to the gigantic Tree of Life that dominates the center of Disney's Animal Kingdom just as the Castle dominates the Magic Kingdom or the Sphere does Epcot. But it's rendered in historically correct style and could probably fool anyone who didn't have a Ph.D. in Indian art history. The next panel shows a mustachioed H. sapiens chopping down the Tree of Life with a scimitar, and the animals fleeing every which way. The one after that shows the misguided human getting walloped by a tidal wave, part of a latter-day Deluge presumably brought on by his stupidity. The final panel, then, portrays the Sapling of Life beginning to grow back, but now Man has ditched the edged weapon and joined the other animals in standing around to adore and praise it. It is, in other words, a prophecy of the Bottleneck: the scenario, commonly espoused among modern-day environmentalists, that the world faces an upcoming period of grave ecological tribulations that will last for a few decades or centuries and end when we find a new harmonious modus vivendi with Nature. Taken as a whole the frieze is a pretty brilliant piece of work. Obviously it's not an ancient Indian ruin, and some person or people now living deserve credit for it. But there are no signatures on the Maharajah's game reserve at Disney World. There are no signatures on anything, because it would ruin the whole effect to have long strings of production credits dangling from every custom-worn brick, as they do from Hollywood movies. Among Hollywood writers, Disney has the reputation of being a real wicked stepmother. It's not hard to see why. Disney is in the business of putting out a product of seamless illusion--a magic mirror that reflects the world back better than it really is. But a writer is literally talking to his or her readers, not just creating an ambience or presenting them with something to look at; and just as the command-line interface opens a much more direct and explicit channel from user to machine than the GUI, so it is with words, writer, and reader. The word, in the end, is the only system of encoding thoughts--the only medium--that is not fungible, that refuses to dissolve in the devouring torrent of electronic media (the richer tourists at Disney World wear t-shirts printed with the names of famous designers, because designs themselves can be bootlegged easily and with impunity. The only way to make clothing that cannot be legally bootlegged is to print copyrighted and trademarked words on it; once you have taken that step, the clothing itself doesn't really matter, and so a t-shirt is as good as anything else. T-shirts with expensive words on them are now the insignia of the upper class. T-shirts with cheap words, or no words at all, are for the commoners). But this special quality of words and of written communication would have the same effect on Disney's product as spray-painted graffiti on a magic mirror. So Disney does most of its communication without resorting to words, and for the most part, the words aren't missed. Some of Disney's older properties, such as Peter Pan, Winnie the Pooh, and Alice in Wonderland, came out of books. But the authors' names are rarely if ever mentioned, and you can't buy the original books at the Disney store. If you could, they would all seem old and queer, like very bad knockoffs of the purer, more authentic Disney versions. Compared to more recent productions like Beauty and the Beast and Mulan, the Disney movies based on these books (particularly Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan) seem deeply bizarre, and not wholly appropriate for children. That stands to reason, because Lewis Carroll and J.M. Barrie were very strange men, and such is the nature of the written word that their personal strangeness shines straight through all the layers of Disneyfication like x-rays through a wall. Probably for this very reason, Disney seems to have stopped buying books altogether, and now finds its themes and characters in folk tales, which have the lapidary, time-worn quality of the ancient bricks in the Maharajah's ruins. If I can risk a broad generalization, most of the people who go to Disney World have zero interest in absorbing new ideas from books. Which sounds snide, but listen: they have no qualms about being presented with ideas in other forms. Disney World is stuffed with environmental messages now, and the guides at Animal Kingdom can talk your ear off about biology. If you followed those tourists home, you might find art, but it would be the sort of unsigned folk art that's for sale in Disney World's African- and Asian-themed stores. In general they only seem comfortable with media that have been ratified by great age, massive popular acceptance, or both. In this world, artists are like the anonymous, illiterate stone carvers who built the great cathedrals of Europe and then faded away into unmarked graves in the churchyard. The cathedral as a whole is awesome and stirring in spite, and possibly because, of the fact that we have no idea who built it. When we walk through it we are communing not with individual stone carvers but with an entire culture. Disney World works the same way. If you are an intellectual type, a reader or writer of books, the nicest thing you can say about this is that the execution is superb. But it's easy to find the whole environment a little creepy, because something is missing: the translation of all its content into clear explicit written words, the attribution of the ideas to specific people. You can't argue with it. It seems as if a hell of a lot might be being glossed over, as if Disney World might be putting one over on us, and possibly getting away with all kinds of buried assumptions and muddled thinking. But this is precisely the same as what is lost in the transition from the command-line interface to the GUI. Disney and Apple/Microsoft are in the same business: short-circuiting laborious, explicit verbal communication with expensively designed interfaces. Disney is a sort of user interface unto itself--and more than just graphical. Let's call it a Sensorial Interface. It can be applied to anything in the world, real or imagined, albeit at staggering expense. Why are we rejecting explicit word-based interfaces, and embracing graphical or sensorial ones--a trend that accounts for the success of both Microsoft and Disney? Part of it is simply that the world is very complicated now--much more complicated than the hunter-gatherer world that our brains evolved to cope with--and we simply can't handle all of the details. We have to delegate. We have no choice but to trust some nameless artist at Disney or programmer at Apple or Microsoft to make a few choices for us, close off some options, and give us a conveniently packaged executive summary. But more importantly, it comes out of the fact that, during this century, intellectualism failed, and everyone knows it. In places like Russia and Germany, the common people agreed to loosen their grip on traditional folkways, mores, and religion, and let the intellectuals run with the ball, and they screwed everything up and turned the century into an abbatoir. Those wordy intellectuals used to be merely tedious; now they seem kind of dangerous as well. We Americans are the only ones who didn't get creamed at some point during all of this. We are free and prosperous because we have inherited political and values systems fabricated by a particular set of eighteenth-century intellectuals who happened to get it right. But we have lost touch with those intellectuals, and with anything like intellectualism, even to the point of not reading books any more, though we are literate. We seem much more comfortable with propagating those values to future generations nonverbally, through a process of being steeped in media. Apparently this actually works to some degree, for police in many lands are now complaining that local arrestees are insisting on having their Miranda rights read to them, just like perps in American TV cop shows. When it's explained to them that they are in a different country, where those rights do not exist, they become outraged. Starsky and Hutch reruns, dubbed into diverse languages, may turn out, in the long run, to be a greater force for human rights than the Declaration of Independence. A huge, rich, nuclear-tipped culture that propagates its core values through media steepage seems like a bad idea. There is an obvious risk of running astray here. Words are the only immutable medium we have, which is why they are the vehicle of choice for extremely important concepts like the Ten Commandments, the Koran, and the Bill of Rights. Unless the messages conveyed by our media are somehow pegged to a fixed, written set of precepts, they can wander all over the place and possibly dump loads of crap into people's minds. Orlando used to have a military installation called McCoy Air Force Base, with long runways from which B-52s could take off and reach Cuba, or just about anywhere else, with loads of nukes. But now McCoy has been scrapped and repurposed. It has been absorbed into Orlando's civilian airport. The long runways are being used to land 747-loads of tourists from Brazil, Italy, Russia and Japan, so that they can come to Disney World and steep in our media for a while. To traditional cultures, especially word-based ones such as Islam, this is infinitely more threatening than the B-52s ever were. It is obvious, to everyone outside of the United States, that our arch-buzzwords, multiculturalism and diversity, are false fronts that are being used (in many cases unwittingly) to conceal a global trend to eradicate cultural differences. The basic tenet of multiculturalism (or \"honoring diversity\" or whatever you want to call it) is that people need to stop judging each other-to stop asserting (and, eventually, to stop believing) that this is right and that is wrong, this true and that false, one thing ugly and another thing beautiful, that God exists and has this or that set of qualities. The lesson most people are taking home from the Twentieth Century is that, in order for a large number of different cultures to coexist peacefully on the globe (or even in a neighborhood) it is necessary for people to suspend judgment in this way. Hence (I would argue) our suspicion of, and hostility towards, all authority figures in modern culture. As David Foster Wallace has explained in his essay \"E Unibus Pluram,\" this is the fundamental message of television; it is the message that people take home, anyway, after they have steeped in our media long enough. It's not expressed in these highfalutin terms, of course. It comes through as the presumption that all authority figures--teachers, generals, cops, ministers, politicians--are hypocritical buffoons, and that hip jaded coolness is the only way to be. The problem is that once you have done away with the ability to make judgments as to right and wrong, true and false, etc., there's no real culture left. All that remains is clog dancing and macrame. The ability to make judgments, to believe things, is the entire it point of having a culture. I think this is why guys with machine guns sometimes pop up in places like Luxor, and begin pumping bullets into Westerners. They perfectly understand the lesson of McCoy Air Force Base. When their sons come home wearing Chicago Bulls caps with the bills turned sideways, the dads go out of their minds. The global anti-culture that has been conveyed into every cranny of the world by television is a culture unto itself, and by the standards of great and ancient cultures like Islam and France, it seems grossly inferior, at least at first. The only good thing you can say about it is that it makes world wars and Holocausts less likely--and that is actually a pretty good thing! The only real problem is that anyone who has no culture, other than this global monoculture, is completely screwed. Anyone who grows up watching TV, never sees any religion or philosophy, is raised in an atmosphere of moral relativism, learns about civics from watching bimbo eruptions on network TV news, and attends a university where postmodernists vie to outdo each other in demolishing traditional notions of truth and quality, is going to come out into the world as one pretty feckless human being. And--again--perhaps the goal of all this is to make us feckless so we won't nuke each other. On the other hand, if you are raised within some specific culture, you end up with a basic set of tools that you can use to think about and understand the world. You might use those tools to reject the culture you were raised in, but at least you've got some tools. In this country, the people who run things--who populate major law firms and corporate boards--understand all of this at some level. They pay lip service to multiculturalism and diversity and non-judgmentalness, but they don't raise their own children that way. I have highly educated, technically sophisticated friends who have moved to small towns in Iowa to live and raise their children, and there are Hasidic Jewish enclaves in New York where large numbers of kids are being brought up according to traditional beliefs. Any suburban community might be thought of as a place where people who hold certain (mostly implicit) beliefs go to live among others who think the same way. And not only do these people feel some responsibility to their own children, but to the country as a whole. Some of the upper class are vile and cynical, of course, but many spend at least part of their time fretting about what direction the country is going in, and what responsibilities they have. And so issues that are important to book-reading intellectuals, such as global environmental collapse, eventually percolate through the porous buffer of mass culture and show up as ancient Hindu ruins in Orlando. You may be asking: what the hell does all this have to do with operating systems? As I've explained, there is no way to explain the domination of the OS market by Apple/Microsoft without looking to cultural explanations, and so I can't get anywhere, in this essay, without first letting you know where I'm coming from vis-a-vis contemporary culture. Contemporary culture is a two-tiered system, like the Morlocks and the Eloi in H.G. Wells's The Time Machine, except that it's been turned upside down. In The Time Machine the Eloi were an effete upper class, supported by lots of subterranean Morlocks who kept the technological wheels turning. But in our world it's the other way round. The Morlocks are in the minority, and they are running the show, because they understand how everything works. The much more numerous Eloi learn everything they know from being steeped from birth in electronic media directed and controlled by book-reading Morlocks. So many ignorant people could be dangerous if they got pointed in the wrong direction, and so we've evolved a popular culture that is (a) almost unbelievably infectious and (b) neuters every person who gets infected by it, by rendering them unwilling to make judgments and incapable of taking stands. Morlocks, who have the energy and intelligence to comprehend details, go out and master complex subjects and produce Disney-like Sensorial Interfaces so that Eloi can get the gist without having to strain their minds or endure boredom. Those Morlocks will go to India and tediously explore a hundred ruins, then come home and built sanitary bug-free versions: highlight films, as it were. This costs a lot, because Morlocks insist on good coffee and first-class airline tickets, but that's no problem because Eloi like to be dazzled and will gladly pay for it all. Now I realize that most of this probably sounds snide and bitter to the point of absurdity: your basic snotty intellectual throwing a tantrum about those unlettered philistines. As if I were a self-styled Moses, coming down from the mountain all alone, carrying the stone tablets bearing the Ten Commandments carved in immutable stone--the original command-line interface--and blowing his stack at the weak, unenlightened Hebrews worshipping images. Not only that, but it sounds like I'm pumping some sort of conspiracy theory. But that is not where I'm going with this. The situation I describe, here, could be bad, but doesn't have to be bad and isn't necessarily bad now: It simply is the case that we are way too busy, nowadays, to comprehend everything in detail. And it's better to comprehend it dimly, through an interface, than not at all. Better for ten million Eloi to go on the Kilimanjaro Safari at Disney World than for a thousand cardiovascular surgeons and mutual fund managers to go on \"real\" ones in Kenya. The boundary between these two classes is more porous than I've made it sound. I'm always running into regular dudes--construction workers, auto mechanics, taxi drivers, galoots in general--who were largely aliterate until something made it necessary for them to become readers and start actually thinking about things. Perhaps they had to come to grips with alcoholism, perhaps they got sent to jail, or came down with a disease, or suffered a crisis in religious faith, or simply got bored. Such people can get up to speed on particular subjects quite rapidly. Sometimes their lack of a broad education makes them over-apt to go off on intellectual wild goose chases, but, hey, at least a wild goose chase gives you some exercise. The spectre of a polity controlled by the fads and whims of voters who actually believe that there are significant differences between Bud Lite and Miller Lite, and who think that professional wrestling is for real, is naturally alarming to people who don't. But then countries controlled via the command-line interface, as it were, by double-domed intellectuals, be they religious or secular, are generally miserable places to live. Sophisticated people deride Disneyesque entertainments as pat and saccharine, but, hey, if the result of that is to instill basically warm and sympathetic reflexes, at a preverbal level, into hundreds of millions of unlettered media-steepers, then how bad can it be? We killed a lobster in our kitchen last night and my daughter cried for an hour. The Japanese, who used to be just about the fiercest people on earth, have become infatuated with cuddly adorable cartoon characters. My own family--the people I know best--is divided about evenly between people who will probably read this essay and people who almost certainly won't, and I can't say for sure that one group is necessarily warmer, happier, or better-adjusted than the other. MORLOCKS AND ELOI AT THE KEYBOARD Back in the days of the command-line interface, users were all Morlocks who had to convert their thoughts into alphanumeric symbols and type them in, a grindingly tedious process that stripped away all ambiguity, laid bare all hidden assumptions, and cruelly punished laziness and imprecision. Then the interface-makers went to work on their GUIs, and introduced a new semiotic layer between people and machines. People who use such systems have abdicated the responsibility, and surrendered the power, of sending bits directly to the chip that's doing the arithmetic, and handed that responsibility and power over to the OS. This is tempting because giving clear instructions, to anyone or anything, is difficult. We cannot do it without thinking, and depending on the complexity of the situation, we may have to think hard about abstract things, and consider any number of ramifications, in order to do a good job of it. For most of us, this is hard work. We want things to be easier. How badly we want it can be measured by the size of Bill Gates's fortune. The OS has (therefore) become a sort of intellectual labor-saving device that tries to translate humans' vaguely expressed intentions into bits. In effect we are asking our computers to shoulder responsibilities that have always been considered the province of human beings--we want them to understand our desires, to anticipate our needs, to foresee consequences, to make connections, to handle routine chores without being asked, to remind us of what we ought to be reminded of while filtering out noise. At the upper (which is to say, closer to the user) levels, this is done through a set of conventions--menus, buttons, and so on. These work in the sense that analogies work: they help Eloi understand abstract or unfamiliar concepts by likening them to something known. But the loftier word \"metaphor\" is used. The overarching concept of the MacOS was the \"desktop metaphor\" and it subsumed any number of lesser (and frequently conflicting, or at least mixed) metaphors. Under a GUI, a file (frequently called \"document\") is metaphrased as a window on the screen (which is called a \"desktop\"). The window is almost always too small to contain the document and so you \"move around,\" or, more pretentiously, \"navigate\" in the document by \"clicking and dragging\" the \"thumb\" on the \"scroll bar.\" When you \"type\" (using a keyboard) or \"draw\" (using a \"mouse\") into the \"window\" or use pull-down \"menus\" and \"dialog boxes\" to manipulate its contents, the results of your labors get stored (at least in theory) in a \"file,\" and later you can pull the same information back up into another \"window.\" When you don't want it anymore, you \"drag\" it into the \"trash.\" There is massively promiscuous metaphor-mixing going on here, and I could deconstruct it 'til the cows come home, but I won't. Consider only one word: \"document.\" When we document something in the real world, we make fixed, permanent, immutable records of it. But computer documents are volatile, ephemeral constellations of data. Sometimes (as when you've just opened or saved them) the document as portrayed in the window is identical to what is stored, under the same name, in a file on the disk, but other times (as when you have made changes without saving them) it is completely different. In any case, every time you hit \"Save\" you annihilate the previous version of the \"document\" and replace it with whatever happens to be in the window at the moment. So even the word \"save\" is being used in a sense that is grotesquely misleading---\"destroy one version, save another\" would be more accurate. Anyone who uses a word processor for very long inevitably has the experience of putting hours of work into a long document and then losing it because the computer crashes or the power goes out. Until the moment that it disappears from the screen, the document seems every bit as solid and real as if it had been typed out in ink on paper. But in the next moment, without warning, it is completely and irretrievably gone, as if it had never existed. The user is left with a feeling of disorientation (to say nothing of annoyance) stemming from a kind of metaphor shear--you realize that you've been living and thinking inside of a metaphor that is essentially bogus. So GUIs use metaphors to make computing easier, but they are bad metaphors. Learning to use them is essentially a word game, a process of learning new definitions of words like \"window\" and \"document\" and \"save\" that are different from, and in many cases almost diametrically opposed to, the old. Somewhat improbably, this has worked very well, at least from a commercial standpoint, which is to say that Apple/Microsoft have made a lot of money off of it. All of the other modern operating systems have learned that in order to be accepted by users they must conceal their underlying gutwork beneath the same sort of spackle. This has some advantages: if you know how to use one GUI operating system, you can probably work out how to use any other in a few minutes. Everything works a little differently, like European plumbing--but with some fiddling around, you can type a memo or surf the web. Most people who shop for OSes (if they bother to shop at all) are comparing not the underlying functions but the superficial look and feel. The average buyer of an OS is not really paying for, and is not especially interested in, the low-level code that allocates memory or writes bytes onto the disk. What we're really buying is a system of metaphors. And--much more important--what we're buying into is the underlying assumption that metaphors are a good way to deal with the world. Recently a lot of new hardware has become available that gives computers numerous interesting ways of affecting the real world: making paper spew out of printers, causing words to appear on screens thousands of miles away, shooting beams of radiation through cancer patients, creating realistic moving pictures of the Titanic. Windows is now used as an OS for cash registers and bank tellers' terminals. My satellite TV system uses a sort of GUI to change channels and show program guides. Modern cellular telephones have a crude GUI built into a tiny LCD screen. Even Legos now have a GUI: you can buy a Lego set called Mindstorms that enables you to build little Lego robots and program them through a GUI on your computer. So we are now asking the GUI to do a lot more than serve as a glorified typewriter. Now we want to become a generalized tool for dealing with reality. This has become a bonanza for companies that make a living out of bringing new technology to the mass market. Obviously you cannot sell a complicated technological system to people without some sort of interface that enables them to use it. The internal combustion engine was a technological marvel in its day, but useless as a consumer good until a clutch, transmission, steering wheel and throttle were connected to it. That odd collection of gizmos, which survives to this day in every car on the road, made up what we would today call a user interface. But if cars had been invented after Macintoshes, carmakers would not have bothered to gin up all of these arcane devices. We would have a computer screen instead of a dashboard, and a mouse (or at best a joystick) instead of a steering wheel, and we'd shift gears by pulling down a menu: PARK --- REVERSE --- NEUTRAL ---- 3 2 1 --- Help... A few lines of computer code can thus be made to substitute for any imaginable mechanical interface. The problem is that in many cases the substitute is a poor one. Driving a car through a GUI would be a miserable experience. Even if the GUI were perfectly bug-free, it would be incredibly dangerous, because menus and buttons simply can't be as responsive as direct mechanical controls. My friend's dad, the gentleman who was restoring the MGB, never would have bothered with it if it had been equipped with a GUI. It wouldn't have been any fun. The steering wheel and gearshift lever were invented during an era when the most complicated technology in most homes was a butter churn. Those early carmakers were simply lucky, in that they could dream up whatever interface was best suited to the task of driving an automobile, and people would learn it. Likewise with the dial telephone and the AM radio. By the time of the Second World War, most people knew several interfaces: they could not only churn butter but also drive a car, dial a telephone, turn on a radio, summon flame from a cigarette lighter, and change a light bulb. But now every little thing--wristwatches, VCRs, stoves--is jammed with features, and every feature is useless without an interface. If you are like me, and like most other consumers, you have never used ninety percent of the available features on your microwave oven, VCR, or cellphone. You don't even know that these features exist. The small benefit they might bring you is outweighed by the sheer hassle of having to learn about them. This has got to be a big problem for makers of consumer goods, because they can't compete without offering features. It's no longer acceptable for engineers to invent a wholly novel user interface for every new product, as they did in the case of the automobile, partly because it's too expensive and partly because ordinary people can only learn so much. If the VCR had been invented a hundred years ago, it would have come with a thumbwheel to adjust the tracking and a gearshift to change between forward and reverse and a big cast-iron handle to load or to eject the cassettes. It would have had a big analog clock on the front of it, and you would have set the time by moving the hands around on the dial. But because the VCR was invented when it was--during a sort of awkward transitional period between the era of mechanical interfaces and GUIs--it just had a bunch of pushbuttons on the front, and in order to set the time you had to push the buttons in just the right way. This must have seemed reasonable enough to the engineers responsible for it, but to many users it was simply impossible. Thus the famous blinking 12:00 that appears on so many VCRs. Computer people call this \"the blinking twelve problem\". When they talk about it, though, they usually aren't talking about VCRs. Modern VCRs usually have some kind of on-screen programming, which means that you can set the time and control other features through a sort of primitive GUI. GUIs have virtual pushbuttons too, of course, but they also have other types of virtual controls, like radio buttons, checkboxes, text entry boxes, dials, and scrollbars. Interfaces made out of these components seem to be a lot easier, for many people, than pushing those little buttons on the front of the machine, and so the blinking 12:00 itself is slowly disappearing from America's living rooms. The blinking twelve problem has moved on to plague other technologies. So the GUI has gone beyond being an interface to personal computers, and become a sort of meta-interface that is pressed into service for every new piece of consumer technology. It is rarely an ideal fit, but having an ideal, or even a good interface is no longer the priority; the important thing now is having some kind of interface that customers will actually use, so that manufacturers can claim, with a straight face, that they are offering new features. We want GUIs largely because they are convenient and because they are easy-- or at least the GUI makes it seem that way Of course, nothing is really easy and simple, and putting a nice interface on top of it does not change that fact. A car controlled through a GUI would be easier to drive than one controlled through pedals and steering wheel, but it would be incredibly dangerous. By using GUIs all the time we have insensibly bought into a premise that few people would have accepted if it were presented to them bluntly: namely, that hard things can be made easy, and complicated things simple, by putting the right interface on them. In order to understand how bizarre this is, imagine that book reviews were written according to the same values system that we apply to user interfaces: \"The writing in this book is marvelously simple-minded and glib; the author glosses over complicated subjects and employs facile generalizations in almost every sentence. Readers rarely have to think, and are spared all of the difficulty and tedium typically involved in reading old-fashioned books.\" As long as we stick to simple operations like setting the clocks on our VCRs, this is not so bad. But as we try to do more ambitious things with our technologies, we inevitably run into the problem of: METAPHOR SHEAR I began using Microsoft Word as soon as the first version was released around 1985. After some initial hassles I found it to be a better tool than MacWrite, which was its only competition at the time. I wrote a lot of stuff in early versions of Word, storing it all on floppies, and transferred the contents of all my floppies to my first hard drive, which I acquired around 1987. As new versions of Word came out I faithfully upgraded, reasoning that as a writer it made sense for me to spend a certain amount of money on tools. Sometime in the mid-1980's I attempted to open one of my old, circa-1985 Word documents using the version of Word then current: 6.0 It didn't work. Word 6.0 did not recognize a document created by an earlier version of itself. By opening it as a text file, I was able to recover the sequences of letters that made up the text of the document. My words were still there. But the formatting had been run through a log chipper--the words I'd written were interrupted by spates of empty rectangular boxes and gibberish. Now, in the context of a business (the chief market for Word) this sort of thing is only an annoyance--one of the routine hassles that go along with using computers. It's easy to buy little file converter programs that will take care of this problem. But if you are a writer whose career is words, whose professional identity is a corpus of written documents, this kind of thing is extremely disquieting. There are very few fixed assumptions in my line of work, but one of them is that once you have written a word, it is written, and cannot be unwritten. The ink stains the paper, the chisel cuts the stone, the stylus marks the clay, and something has irrevocably happened (my brother-in-law is a theologian who reads 3250-year-old cuneiform tablets--he can recognize the handwriting of particular scribes, and identify them by name). But word-processing software--particularly the sort that employs special, complex file formats--has the eldritch power to unwrite things. A small change in file formats, or a few twiddled bits, and months' or years' literary output can cease to exist. Now this was technically a fault in the application (Word 6.0 for the Macintosh) not the operating system (MacOS 7 point something) and so the initial target of my annoyance was the people who were responsible for Word. But. On the other hand, I could have chosen the \"save as text\" option in Word and saved all of my documents as simple telegrams, and this problem would not have arisen. Instead I had allowed myself to be seduced by all of those flashy formatting options that hadn't even existed until GUIs had come along to make them practicable. I had gotten into the habit of using them to make my documents look pretty (perhaps prettier than they deserved to look; all of the old documents on those floppies turned out to be more or less crap). Now I was paying the price for that self-indulgence. Technology had moved on and found ways to make my documents look even prettier, and the consequence of it was that all old ugly documents had ceased to exist. It was--if you'll pardon me for a moment's strange little fantasy--as if I'd gone to stay at some resort, some exquisitely designed and art-directed hotel, placing myself in the hands of past masters of the Sensorial Interface, and had sat down in my room and written a story in ballpoint pen on a yellow legal pad, and when I returned from dinner, discovered that the maid had taken my work away and left behind in its place a quill pen and a stack of fine parchment--explaining that the room looked ever so much finer this way, and it was all part of a routine upgrade. But written on these sheets of paper, in flawless penmanship, were long sequences of words chosen at random from the dictionary. Appalling, sure, but I couldn't really lodge a complaint with the management, because by staying at this resort I had given my consent to it. I had surrendered my Morlock credentials and become an Eloi. LINUX During the late 1980's and early 1990's I spent a lot of time programming Macintoshes, and eventually decided for fork over several hundred dollars for an Apple product called the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop, or MPW. MPW had competitors, but it was unquestionably the premier software development system for the Mac. It was what Apple's own engineers used to write Macintosh code. Given that MacOS was far more technologically advanced, at the time, than its competition, and that Linux did not even exist yet, and given that this was the actual program used by Apple's world-class team of creative engineers, I had high expectations. It arrived on a stack of floppy disks about a foot high, and so there was plenty of time for my excitement to build during the endless installation process. The first time I launched MPW, I was probably expecting some kind of touch-feely multimedia showcase. Instead it was austere, almost to the point of being intimidating. It was a scrolling window into which you could type simple, unformatted text. The system would then interpret these lines of text as commands, and try to execute them. It was, in other words, a glass teletype running a command line interface. It came with all sorts of cryptic but powerful commands, which could be invoked by typing their names, and which I learned to use only gradually. It was not until a few years later, when I began messing around with Unix, that I understood that the command line interface embodied in MPW was a re-creation of Unix. In other words, the first thing that Apple's hackers had done when they'd got the MacOS up and running--probably even before they'd gotten it up and running--was to re-create the Unix interface, so that they would be able to get some useful work done. At the time, I simply couldn't get my mind around this, but: as far as Apple's hackers were concerned, the Mac's vaunted Graphical User Interface was an impediment, something to be circumvented before the little toaster even came out onto the market. Even before my Powerbook crashed and obliterated my big file in July 1995, there had been danger signs. An old college buddy of mine, who starts and runs high-tech companies in Boston, had developed a commercial product using Macintoshes as the front end. Basically the Macs were high-performance graphics terminals, chosen for their sweet user interface, giving users access to a large database of graphical information stored on a network of much more powerful, but less user-friendly, computers. This fellow was the second person who turned me on to Macintoshes, by the way, and through the mid-1980's we had shared the thrill of being high-tech cognoscenti, using superior Apple technology in a world of DOS-using knuckleheads. Early versions of my friend's system had worked well, he told me, but when several machines joined the network, mysterious crashes began to occur; sometimes the whole network would just freeze. It was one of those bugs that could not be reproduced easily. Finally they figured out that these network crashes were triggered whenever a user, scanning the menus for a particular item, held down the mouse button for more than a couple of seconds. Fundamentally, the MacOS could only do one thing at a time. Drawing a menu on the screen is one thing. So when a menu was pulled down, the Macintosh was not capable of doing anything else until that indecisive user released the button. This is not such a bad thing in a single-user, single-process machine (although it's a fairly bad thing), but it's no good in a machine that is on a network, because being on a network implies some kind of continual low-level interaction with other machines. By failing to respond to the network, the Mac caused a network-wide crash. In order to work with other computers, and with networks, and with various different types of hardware, an OS must be incomparably more complicated and powerful than either MS-DOS or the original MacOS. The only way of connecting to the Internet that's worth taking seriously is PPP, the Point-to-Point Protocol, which (never mind the details) makes your computer--temporarily--a full-fledged member of the Global Internet, with its own unique address, and various privileges, powers, and responsibilities appertaining thereunto. Technically it means your machine is running the TCP/IP protocol, which, to make a long story short, revolves around sending packets of data back and forth, in no particular order, and at unpredictable times, according to a clever and elegant set of rules. But sending a packet of data is one thing, and so an OS that can only do one thing at a time cannot simultaneously be part of the Internet and do anything else. When TCP/IP was invented, running it was an honor reserved for Serious Computers--mainframes and high-powered minicomputers used in technical and commercial settings--and so the protocol is engineered around the assumption that every computer using it is a serious machine, capable of doing many things at once. Not to put too fine a point on it, a Unix machine. Neither MacOS nor MS-DOS was originally built with that in mind, and so when the Internet got hot, radical changes had to be made. When my Powerbook broke my heart, and when Word stopped recognizing my old files, I jumped to Unix. The obvious alternative to MacOS would have been Windows. I didn't really have anything against Microsoft, or Windows. But it was pretty obvious, now, that old PC operating systems were overreaching, and showing the strain, and, perhaps, were best avoided until they had learned to walk and chew gum at the same time. The changeover took place on a particular day in the summer of 1995. I had been San Francisco for a couple of weeks, using my PowerBook to work on a document. The document was too big to fit onto a single floppy, and so I hadn't made a backup since leaving home. The PowerBook crashed and wiped out the entire file. It happened just as I was on my way out the door to visit a company called Electric Communities, which in those days was in Los Altos. I took my PowerBook with me. My friends at Electric Communities were Mac users who had all sorts of utility software for unerasing files and recovering from disk crashes, and I was certain I could get most of the file back. As it turned out, two different Mac crash recovery utilities were unable to find any trace that my file had ever existed. It was completely and systematically wiped out. We went through that hard disk block by block and found disjointed fragments of countless old, discarded, forgotten files, but none of what I wanted. The metaphor shear was especially brutal that day. It was sort of like watching the girl you've been in love with for ten years get killed in a car wreck, and then attending her autopsy, and learning that underneath the clothes and makeup she was just flesh and blood. I must have been reeling around the offices of Electric Communities in some kind of primal Jungian fugue, because at this moment three weirdly synchronistic things happened. (1) Randy Farmer, a co-founder of the company, came in for a quick visit along with his family--he was recovering from back surgery at the time. He had some hot gossip: \"Windows 95 mastered today.\" What this meant was that Microsoft's new operating system had, on this day, been placed on a special compact disk known as a golden master, which would be used to stamp out a jintillion copies in preparation for its thunderous release a few weeks later. This news was received peevishly by the staff of Electric Communities, including one whose office door was plastered with the usual assortment of cartoons and novelties, e.g. (2) a copy of a Dilbert cartoon in which Dilbert, the long-suffering corporate software engineer, encounters a portly, bearded, hairy man of a certain age--a bit like Santa Claus, but darker, with a certain edge about him. Dilbert recognizes this man, based upon his appearance and affect, as a Unix hacker, and reacts with a certain mixture of nervousness, awe, and hostility. Dilbert jabs weakly at the disturbing interloper for a couple of frames; the Unix hacker listens with a kind of infuriating, beatific calm, then, in the last frame, reaches into his pocket. \"Here's a nickel, kid,\" he says, \"go buy yourself a real computer.\" (3) the owner of the door, and the cartoon, was one Doug Barnes. Barnes was known to harbor certain heretical opinions on the subject of operating systems. Unlike most Bay Area techies who revered the Macintosh, considering it to be a true hacker's machine, Barnes was fond of pointing out that the Mac, with its hermetically sealed architecture, was actually hostile to hackers, who are prone to tinkering and dogmatic about openness. By contrast, the IBM-compatible line of machines, which can easily be taken apart and plugged back together, was much more hackable. So when I got home I began messing around with Linux, which is one of many, many different concrete implementations of the abstract, Platonic ideal called Unix. I was not looking forward to changing over to a new OS, because my credit cards were still smoking from all the money I'd spent on Mac hardware over the years. But Linux's great virtue was, and is, that it would run on exactly the same sort of hardware as the Microsoft OSes--which is to say, the cheapest hardware in existence. As if to demonstrate why this was a great idea, I was, within a week or two of returning home, able to get my hand on a then-decent computer (a 33-MHz 486 box) for free, because I knew a guy who worked in an office where they were simply being thrown away. Once I got it home, I yanked the hood off, stuck my hands in, and began switching cards around. If something didn't work, I went to a used-computer outlet and pawed through a bin full of components and bought a new card for a few bucks. The availability of all this cheap but effective hardware was an unintended consequence of decisions that had been made more than a decade earlier by IBM and Microsoft. When Windows came out, and brought the GUI to a much larger market, the hardware regime changed: the cost of color video cards and high-resolution monitors began to drop, and is dropping still. This free-for-all approach to hardware meant that Windows was unavoidably clunky compared to MacOS. But the GUI brought computing to such a vast audience that volume went way up and prices collapsed. Meanwhile Apple, which so badly wanted a clean, integrated OS with video neatly integrated into processing hardware, had fallen far behind in market share, at least partly because their beautiful hardware cost so much. But the price that we Mac owners had to pay for superior aesthetics and engineering was not merely a financial one. There was a cultural price too, stemming from the fact that we couldn't open up the hood and mess around with it. Doug Barnes was right. Apple, in spite of its reputation as the machine of choice of scruffy, creative hacker types, had actually created a machine that discouraged hacking, while Microsoft, viewed as a technological laggard and copycat, had created a vast, disorderly parts bazaar--a primordial soup that eventually self-assembled into Linux. THE HOLE HAWG OF OPERATING SYSTEMS Unix has always lurked provocatively in the background of the operating system wars, like the Russian Army. Most people know it only by reputation, and its reputation, as the Dilbert cartoon suggests, is mixed. But everyone seems to agree that if it could only get its act together and stop surrendering vast tracts of rich agricultural land and hundreds of thousands of prisoners of war to the onrushing invaders, it could stomp them (and all other opposition) flat. It is difficult to explain how Unix has earned this respect without going into mind-smashing technical detail. Perhaps the gist of it can be explained by telling a story about drills. The Hole Hawg is a drill made by the Milwaukee Tool Company. If you look in a typical hardware store you may find smaller Milwaukee drills but not the Hole Hawg, which is too powerful and too expensive for homeowners. The Hole Hawg does not have the pistol-like design of a cheap homeowner's drill. It is a cube of solid metal with a handle sticking out of one face and a chuck mounted in another. The cube contains a disconcertingly potent electric motor. You can hold the handle and operate the trigger with your index finger, but unless you are exceptionally strong you cannot control the weight of the Hole Hawg with one hand; it is a two-hander all the way. In order to fight off the counter-torque of the Hole Hawg you use a separate handle (provided), which you screw into one side of the iron cube or the other depending on whether you are using your left or right hand to operate the trigger. This handle is not a sleek, ergonomically designed item as it would be in a homeowner's drill. It is simply a foot-long chunk of regular galvanized pipe, threaded on one end, with a black rubber handle on the other. If you lose it, you just go to the local plumbing supply store and buy another chunk of pipe. During the Eighties I did some construction work. One day, another worker leaned a ladder against the outside of the building that we were putting up, climbed up to the second-story level, and used the Hole Hawg to drill a hole through the exterior wall. At some point, the drill bit caught in the wall. The Hole Hawg, following its one and only imperative, kept going. It spun the worker's body around like a rag doll, causing him to knock his own ladder down. Fortunately he kept his grip on the Hole Hawg, which remained lodged in the wall, and he simply dangled from it and shouted for help until someone came along and reinstated the ladder. I myself used a Hole Hawg to drill many holes through studs, which it did as a blender chops cabbage. I also used it to cut a few six-inch-diameter holes through an old lath-and-plaster ceiling. I chucked in a new hole saw, went up to the second story, reached down between the newly installed floor joists, and began to cut through the first-floor ceiling below. Where my homeowner's drill had labored and whined to spin the huge bit around, and had stalled at the slightest obstruction, the Hole Hawg rotated with the stupid consistency of a spinning planet. When the hole saw seized up, the Hole Hawg spun itself and me around, and crushed one of my hands between the steel pipe handle and a joist, producing a few lacerations, each surrounded by a wide corona of deeply bruised flesh. It also bent the hole saw itself, though not so badly that I couldn't use it. After a few such run-ins, when I got ready to use the Hole Hawg my heart actually began to pound with atavistic terror. But I never blamed the Hole Hawg; I blamed myself. The Hole Hawg is dangerous because it does exactly what you tell it to. It is not bound by the physical limitations that are inherent in a cheap drill, and neither is it limited by safety interlocks that might be built into a homeowner's product by a liability-conscious manufacturer. The danger lies not in the machine itself but in the user's failure to envision the full consequences of the instructions he gives to it. A smaller tool is dangerous too, but for a completely different reason: it tries to do what you tell it to, and fails in some way that is unpredictable and almost always undesirable. But the Hole Hawg is like the genie of the ancient fairy tales, who carries out his master's instructions literally and precisely and with unlimited power, often with disastrous, unforeseen consequences. Pre-Hole Hawg, I used to examine the drill selection in hardware stores with what I thought was a judicious eye, scorning the smaller low-end models and hefting the big expensive ones appreciatively, wishing I could afford one of them babies. Now I view them all with such contempt that I do not even consider them to be real drills--merely scaled-up toys designed to exploit the self-delusional tendencies of soft-handed homeowners who want to believe that they have purchased an actual tool. Their plastic casings, carefully designed and focus-group-tested to convey a feeling of solidity and power, seem disgustingly flimsy and cheap to me, and I am ashamed that I was ever bamboozled into buying such knicknacks. It is not hard to imagine what the world would look like to someone who had been raised by contractors and who had never used any drill other than a Hole Hawg. Such a person, presented with the best and most expensive hardware-store drill, would not even recognize it as such. He might instead misidentify it as a child's toy, or some kind of motorized screwdriver. If a salesperson or a deluded homeowner referred to it as a drill, he would laugh and tell them that they were mistaken--they simply had their terminology wrong. His interlocutor would go away irritated, and probably feeling rather defensive about his basement full of cheap, dangerous, flashy, colorful tools. Unix is the Hole Hawg of operating systems, and Unix hackers, like Doug Barnes and the guy in the Dilbert cartoon and many of the other people who populate Silicon Valley, are like contractor's sons who grew up using only Hole Hawgs. They might use Apple/Microsoft OSes to write letters, play video games, or balance their checkbooks, but they cannot really bring themselves to take these operating systems seriously. THE ORAL TRADITION Unix is hard to learn. The process of learning it is one of multiple small epiphanies. Typically you are just on the verge of inventing some necessary tool or utility when you realize that someone else has already invented it, and built it in, and this explains some odd file or directory or command that you have noticed but never really understood before. For example there is a command (a small program, part of the OS) called whoami, which enables you to ask the computer who it thinks you are. On a Unix machine, you are always logged in under some name--possibly even your own! What files you may work with, and what software you may use, depends on your identity. When I started out using Linux, I was on a non-networked machine in my basement, with only one user account, and so when I became aware of the whoami command it struck me as ludicrous. But once you are logged in as one person, you can temporarily switch over to a pseudonym in order to access different files. If your machine is on the Internet, you can log onto other computers, provided you have a user name and a password. At that point the distant machine becomes no different in practice from the one right in front of you. These changes in identity and location can easily become nested inside each other, many layers deep, even if you aren't doing anything nefarious. Once you have forgotten who and where you are, the whoami command is indispensible. I use it all the time. The file systems of Unix machines all have the same general structure. On your flimsy operating systems, you can create directories (folders) and give them names like Frodo or My Stuff and put them pretty much anywhere you like. But under Unix the highest level--the root--of the filesystem is always designated with the single character \"/\" and it always contains the same set of top-level directories: /usr /etc /var /bin /proc /boot /home /root /sbin /dev /lib /tmp and each of these directories typically has its own distinct structure of subdirectories. Note the obsessive use of abbreviations and avoidance of capital letters; this is a system invented by people to whom repetitive stress disorder is what black lung is to miners. Long names get worn down to three-letter nubbins, like stones smoothed by a river. This is not the place to try to explain why each of the above directories exists, and what is contained in it. At first it all seems obscure; worse, it seems deliberately obscure. When I started using Linux I was accustomed to being able to create directories wherever I wanted and to give them whatever names struck my fancy. Under Unix you are free to do that, of course (you are free to do anything) but as you gain experience with the system you come to understand that the directories listed above were created for the best of reasons and that your life will be much easier if you follow along (within /home, by the way, you have pretty much unlimited freedom). After this kind of thing has happened several hundred or thousand times, the hacker understands why Unix is the way it is, and agrees that it wouldn't be the same any other way. It is this sort of acculturation that gives Unix hackers their confidence in the system, and the attitude of calm, unshakable, annoying superiority captured in the Dilbert cartoon. Windows 95 and MacOS are products, contrived by engineers in the service of specific companies. Unix, by contrast, is not so much a product as it is a painstakingly compiled oral history of the hacker subculture. It is our Gilgamesh epic. What made old epics like Gilgamesh so powerful and so long-lived was that they were living bodies of narrative that many people knew by heart, and told over and over again--making their own personal embellishments whenever it struck their fancy. The bad embellishments were shouted down, the good ones picked up by others, polished, improved, and, over time, incorporated into the story. Likewise, Unix is known, loved, and understood by so many hackers that it can be re-created from scratch whenever someone needs it. This is very difficult to understand for people who are accustomed to thinking of OSes as things that absolutely have to be bought. Many hackers have launched more or less successful re-implementations of the Unix ideal. Each one brings in new embellishments. Some of them die out quickly, some are merged with similar, parallel innovations created by different hackers attacking the same problem, others still are embraced, and adopted into the epic. Thus Unix has slowly accreted around a simple kernel and acquired a kind of complexity and asymmetry about it that is organic, like the roots of a tree, or the branchings of a coronary artery. Understanding it is more like anatomy than physics. For at least a year, prior to my adoption of Linux, I had been hearing about it. Credible, well-informed people kept telling me that a bunch of hackers had got together an implentation of Unix that could be downloaded, free of charge, from the Internet. For a long time I could not bring myself to take the notion seriously. It was like hearing rumors that a group of model rocket enthusiasts had created a completely functional Saturn V by exchanging blueprints on the Net and mailing valves and flanges to each other. But it's true. Credit for Linux generally goes to its human namesake, one Linus Torvalds, a Finn who got the whole thing rolling in 1991 when he used some of the GNU tools to write the beginnings of a Unix kernel that could run on PC-compatible hardware. And indeed Torvalds deserves all the credit he has ever gotten, and a whole lot more. But he could not have made it happen by himself, any more than Richard Stallman could have. To write code at all, Torvalds had to have cheap but powerful development tools, and these he got from Stallman's GNU project. And he had to have cheap hardware on which to write that code. Cheap hardware is a much harder thing to arrange than cheap software; a single person (Stallman) can write software and put it up on the Net for free, but in order to make hardware it's necessary to have a whole industrial infrastructure, which is not cheap by any stretch of the imagination. Really the only way to make hardware cheap is to punch out an incredible number of copies of it, so that the unit cost eventually drops. For reasons already explained, Apple had no desire to see the cost of hardware drop. The only reason Torvalds had cheap hardware was Microsoft. Microsoft refused to go into the hardware business, insisted on making its software run on hardware that anyone could build, and thereby created the market conditions that allowed hardware prices to plummet. In trying to understand the Linux phenomenon, then, we have to look not to a single innovator but to a sort of bizarre Trinity: Linus Torvalds, Richard Stallman, and Bill Gates. Take away any of these three and Linux would not exist. OS SHOCK Young Americans who leave their great big homogeneous country and visit some other part of the world typically go through several stages of culture shock: first, dumb wide-eyed astonishment. Then a tentative engagement with the new country's manners, cuisine, public transit systems and toilets, leading to a brief period of fatuous confidence that they are instant experts on the new country. As the visit wears on, homesickness begins to set in, and the traveler begins to appreciate, for the first time, how much he or she took for granted at home. At the same time it begins to seem obvious that many of one's own cultures and traditions are essentially arbitrary, and could have been different; driving on the right side of the road, for example. When the traveler returns home and takes stock of the experience, he or she may have learned a good deal more about America than about the country they went to visit. For the same reasons, Linux is worth trying. It is a strange country indeed, but you don't have to live there; a brief sojourn suffices to give some flavor of the place and--more importantly--to lay bare everything that is taken for granted, and all that could have been done differently, under Windows or MacOS. You can't try it unless you install it. With any other OS, installing it would be a straightforward transaction: in exchange for money, some company would give you a CD-ROM, and you would be on your way. But a lot is subsumed in that kind of transaction, and has to be gone through and picked apart. We like plain dealings and straightforward transactions in America. If you go to Egypt and, say, take a taxi somewhere, you become a part of the taxi driver's life; he refuses to take your money because it would demean your friendship, he follows you around town, and weeps hot tears when you get in some other guy's taxi. You end up meeting his kids at some point, and have to devote all sort of ingenuity to finding some way to compensate him without insulting his honor. It is exhausting. Sometimes you just want a simple Manhattan-style taxi ride. But in order to have an American-style setup, where you can just go out and hail a taxi and be on your way, there must exist a whole hidden apparatus of medallions, inspectors, commissions, and so forth--which is fine as long as taxis are cheap and you can always get one. When the system fails to work in some way, it is mysterious and infuriating and turns otherwise reasonable people into conspiracy theorists. But when the Egyptian system breaks down, it breaks down transparently. You can't get a taxi, but your driver's nephew will show up, on foot, to explain the problem and apologize. Microsoft and Apple do things the Manhattan way, with vast complexity hidden behind a wall of interface. Linux does things the Egypt way, with vast complexity strewn about all over the landscape. If you've just flown in from Manhattan, your first impulse will be to throw up your hands and say \"For crying out loud! Will you people get a grip on yourselves!?\" But this does not make friends in Linux-land any better than it would in Egypt. You can suck Linux right out of the air, as it were, by downloading the right files and putting them in the right places, but there probably are not more than a few hundred people in the world who could create a functioning Linux system in that way. What you really need is a distribution of Linux, which means a prepackaged set of files. But distributions are a separate thing from Linux per se. Linux per se is not a specific set of ones and zeroes, but a self-organizing Net subculture. The end result of its collective lucubrations is a vast body of source code, almost all written in C (the dominant computer programming language). \"Source code\" just means a computer program as typed in and edited by some hacker. If it's in C, the file name will probably have .c or .cpp on the end of it, depending on which dialect was used; if it's in some other language it will have some other suffix. Frequently these sorts of files can be found in a directory with the name /src which is the hacker's Hebraic abbreviation of \"source.\" Source files are useless to your computer, and of little interest to most users, but they are of gigantic cultural and political significance, because Microsoft and Apple keep them secret while Linux makes them public. They are the family jewels. They are the sort of thing that in Hollywood thrillers is used as a McGuffin: the plutonium bomb core, the top-secret blueprints, the suitcase of bearer bonds, the reel of microfilm. If the source files for Windows or MacOS were made public on the Net, then those OSes would become free, like Linux--only not as good, because no one would be around to fix bugs and answer questions. Linux is \"open source\" software meaning, simply, that anyone can get copies of its source code files. Your computer doesn't want source code any more than you do; it wants object code. Object code files typically have the suffix .o and are unreadable all but a few, highly strange humans, because they consist of ones and zeroes. Accordingly, this sort of file commonly shows up in a directory with the name /bin, for \"binary.\" Source files are simply ASCII text files. ASCII denotes a particular way of encoding letters into bit patterns. In an ASCII file, each character has eight bits all to itself. This creates a potential \"alphabet\" of 256 distinct characters, in that eight binary digits can form that many unique patterns. In practice, of course, we tend to limit ourselves to the familiar letters and digits. The bit-patterns used to represent those letters and digits are the same ones that were physically punched into the paper tape by my high school teletype, which in turn were the same one used by the telegraph industry for decades previously. ASCII text files, in other words, are telegrams, and as such they have no typographical frills. But for the same reason they are eternal, because the code never changes, and universal, because every text editing and word processing software ever written knows about this code. Therefore just about any software can be used to create, edit, and read source code files. Object code files, then, are created from these source files by a piece of software called a compiler, and forged into a working application by another piece of software called a linker. The triad of editor, compiler, and linker, taken together, form the core of a software development system. Now, it is possible to spend a lot of money on shrink-wrapped development systems with lovely graphical user interfaces and various ergonomic enhancements. In some cases it might even be a good and reasonable way to spend money. But on this side of the road, as it were, the very best software is usually the free stuff. Editor, compiler and linker are to hackers what ponies, stirrups, and archery sets were to the Mongols. Hackers live in the saddle, and hack on their own tools even while they are using them to create new applications. It is quite inconceivable that superior hacking tools could have been created from a blank sheet of paper by product engineers. Even if they are the brightest engineers in the world they are simply outnumbered. In the GNU/Linux world there are two major text editing programs: the minimalist vi (known in some implementations as elvis) and the maximalist emacs. I use emacs, which might be thought of as a thermonuclear word processor. It was created by Richard Stallman; enough said. It is written in Lisp, which is the only computer language that is beautiful. It is colossal, and yet it only edits straight ASCII text files, which is to say, no fonts, no boldface, no underlining. In other words, the engineer-hours that, in the case of Microsoft Word, were devoted to features like mail merge, and the ability to embed feature-length motion pictures in corporate memoranda, were, in the case of emacs, focused with maniacal intensity on the deceptively simple-seeming problem of editing text. If you are a professional writer--i.e., if someone else is getting paid to worry about how your words are formatted and printed--emacs outshines all other editing software in approximately the same way that the noonday sun does the stars. It is not just bigger and brighter; it simply makes everything else vanish. For page layout and printing you can use TeX: a vast corpus of typesetting lore written in C and also available on the Net for free. I could say a lot about emacs and TeX, but right now I am trying to tell a story about how to actually install Linux on your machine. The hard-core survivalist approach would be to download an editor like emacs, and the GNU Tools--the compiler and linker--which are polished and excellent to the same degree as emacs. Equipped with these, one would be able to start downloading ASCII source code files (/src) and compiling them into binary object code files (/bin) that would run on the machine. But in order to even arrive at this point--to get emacs running, for example--you have to have Linux actually up and running on your machine. And even a minimal Linux operating system requires thousands of binary files all acting in concert, and arranged and linked together just so. Several entities have therefore taken it upon themselves to create \"distributions\" of Linux. If I may extend the Egypt analogy slightly, these entities are a bit like tour guides who meet you at the airport, who speak your language, and who help guide you through the initial culture shock. If you are an Egyptian, of course, you see it the other way; tour guides exist to keep brutish outlanders from traipsing through your mosques and asking you the same questions over and over and over again. Some of these tour guides are commercial organizations, such as Red Hat Software, which makes a Linux distribution called Red Hat that has a relatively commercial sheen to it. In most cases you put a Red Hat CD-ROM into your PC and reboot and it handles the rest. Just as a tour guide in Egypt will expect some sort of compensation for his services, commercial distributions need to be paid for. In most cases they cost almost nothing and are well worth it. I use a distribution called Debian (the word is a contraction of \"Deborah\" and \"Ian\") which is non-commercial. It is organized (or perhaps I should say \"it has organized itself\") along the same lines as Linux in general, which is to say that it consists of volunteers who collaborate over the Net, each responsible for looking after a different chunk of the system. These people have broken Linux down into a number of packages, which are compressed files that can be downloaded to an already functioning Debian Linux system, then opened up and unpacked using a free installer application. Of course, as such, Debian has no commercial arm--no distribution mechanism. You can download all Debian packages over the Net, but most people will want to have them on a CD-ROM. Several different companies have taken it upon themselves to decoct all of the current Debian packages onto CD-ROMs and then sell them. I buy mine from Linux Systems Labs. The cost for a three-disc set, containing Debian in its entirety, is less than three dollars. But (and this is an important distinction) not a single penny of that three dollars is going to any of the coders who created Linux, nor to the Debian packagers. It goes to Linux Systems Labs and it pays, not for the software, or the packages, but for the cost of stamping out the CD-ROMs. Every Linux distribution embodies some more or less clever hack for circumventing the normal boot process and causing your computer, when it is turned on, to organize itself, not as a PC running Windows, but as a \"host\" running Unix. This is slightly alarming the first time you see it, but completely harmless. When a PC boots up, it goes through a little self-test routine, taking an inventory of available disks and memory, and then begins looking around for a disk to boot up from. In any normal Windows computer that disk will be a hard drive. But if you have your system configured right, it will look first for a floppy or CD-ROM disk, and boot from that if one is available. Linux exploits this chink in the defenses. Your computer notices a bootable disk in the floppy or CD-ROM drive, loads in some object code from that disk, and blindly begins to execute it. But this is not Microsoft or Apple code, this is Linux code, and so at this point your computer begins to behave very differently from what you are accustomed to. Cryptic messages began to scroll up the screen. If you had booted a commercial OS, you would, at this point, be seeing a \"Welcome to MacOS\" cartoon, or a screen filled with clouds in a blue sky, and a Windows logo. But under Linux you get a long telegram printed in stark white letters on a black screen. There is no \"welcome!\" message. Most of the telegram has the semi-inscrutable menace of graffiti tags.

And yet it's noteworthy that Linux doesn't stop, or crash, when it encounters an error; it spits out a pithy complaint, gives up on whatever processes were damaged, and keeps on rolling. This was decidedly not true of the early versions of Apple and Microsoft OSes, for the simple reason that an OS that is not capable of walking and chewing gum at the same time cannot possibly recover from errors. Looking for, and dealing with, errors requires a separate process running in parallel with the one that has erred. A kind of superego, if you will, that keeps an eye on all of the others, and jumps in when one goes astray. Now that MacOS and Windows can do more than one thing at a time they are much better at dealing with errors than they used to be, but they are not even close to Linux or other Unices in this respect; and their greater complexity has made them vulnerable to new types of errors. FALLIBILITY, ATONEMENT, REDEMPTION, TRUST, AND OTHER ARCANE TECHNICAL CONCEPTS Linux is not capable of having any centrally organized policies dictating how to write error messages and documentation, and so each programmer writes his own. Usually they are in English even though tons of Linux programmers are Europeans. Frequently they are funny. Always they are honest. If something bad has happened because the software simply isn't finished yet, or because the user screwed something up, this will be stated forthrightly. The command line interface makes it easy for programs to dribble out little comments, warnings, and messages here and there. Even if the application is imploding like a damaged submarine, it can still usually eke out a little S.O.S. message. Sometimes when you finish working with a program and shut it down, you find that it has left behind a series of mild warnings and low-grade error messages in the command-line interface window from which you launched it. As if the software were chatting to you about how it was doing the whole time you were working with it. Documentation, under Linux, comes in the form of man (short for manual) pages. You can access these either through a GUI (xman) or from the command line (man). Here is a sample from the man page for a program called rsh: \"Stop signals stop the local rsh process only; this is arguably wrong, but currently hard to fix for reasons too complicated to explain here.\" The man pages contain a lot of such material, which reads like the terse mutterings of pilots wrestling with the controls of damaged airplanes. The general feel is of a thousand monumental but obscure struggles seen in the stop-action light of a strobe. Each programmer is dealing with his own obstacles and bugs; he is too busy fixing them, and improving the software, to explain things at great length or to maintain elaborate pretensions. In practice you hardly ever encounter a serious bug while running Linux. When you do, it is almost always with commercial software (several vendors sell software that runs under Linux). The operating system and its fundamental utility programs are too important to contain serious bugs. I have been running Linux every day since late 1995 and have seen many application programs go down in flames, but I have never seen the operating system crash. Never. Not once. There are quite a few Linux systems that have been running continuously and working hard for months or years without needing to be rebooted. Commercial OSes have to adopt the same official stance towards errors as Communist countries had towards poverty. For doctrinal reasons it was not possible to admit that poverty was a serious problem in Communist countries, because the whole point of Communism was to eradicate poverty. Likewise, commercial OS companies like Apple and Microsoft can't go around admitting that their software has bugs and that it crashes all the time, any more than Disney can issue press releases stating that Mickey Mouse is an actor in a suit. This is a problem, because errors do exist and bugs do happen. Every few months Bill Gates tries to demo a new Microsoft product in front of a large audience only to have it blow up in his face. Commercial OS vendors, as a direct consequence of being commercial, are forced to adopt the grossly disingenuous position that bugs are rare aberrations, usually someone else's fault, and therefore not really worth talking about in any detail. This posture, which everyone knows to be absurd, is not limited to press releases and ad campaigns. It informs the whole way these companies do business and relate to their customers. If the documentation were properly written, it would mention bugs, errors, and crashes on every single page. If the on-line help systems that come with these OSes reflected the experiences and concerns of their users, they would largely be devoted to instructions on how to cope with crashes and errors. But this does not happen. Joint stock corporations are wonderful inventions that have given us many excellent goods and services. They are good at many things. Admitting failure is not one of them. Hell, they can't even admit minor shortcomings. Of course, this behavior is not as pathological in a corporation as it would be in a human being. Most people, nowadays, understand that corporate press releases are issued for the benefit of the corporation's shareholders and not for the enlightenment of the public. Sometimes the results of this institutional dishonesty can be dreadful, as with tobacco and asbestos. In the case of commercial OS vendors it is nothing of the kind, of course; it is merely annoying. Some might argue that consumer annoyance, over time, builds up into a kind of hardened plaque that can conceal serious decay, and that honesty might therefore be the best policy in the long run; the jury is still out on this in the operating system market. The business is expanding fast enough that it's still much better to have billions of chronically annoyed customers than millions of happy ones. Most system administrators I know who work with Windows NT all the time agree that when it hits a snag, it has to be re-booted, and when it gets seriously messed up, the only way to fix it is to re-install the operating system from scratch. Or at least this is the only way that they know of to fix it, which amounts to the same thing. It is quite possible that the engineers at Microsoft have all sorts of insider knowledge on how to fix the system when it goes awry, but if they do, they do not seem to be getting the message out to any of the actual system administrators I know. Because Linux is not commercial--because it is, in fact, free, as well as rather difficult to obtain, install, and operate--it does not have to maintain any pretensions as to its reliability. Consequently, it is much more reliable. When something goes wrong with Linux, the error is noticed and loudly discussed right away. Anyone with the requisite technical knowledge can go straight to the source code and point out the source of the error, which is then rapidly fixed by whichever hacker has carved out responsibility for that particular program. As far as I know, Debian is the only Linux distribution that has its own constitution (http://www.debian.org/devel/constitution), but what really sold me on it was its phenomenal bug database (http://www.debian.org/Bugs), which is a sort of interactive Doomsday Book of error, fallibility, and redemption. It is simplicity itself. When had a problem with Debian in early January of 1997, I sent in a message describing the problem to submit@bugs.debian.org. My problem was promptly assigned a bug report number (#6518) and a severity level (the available choices being critical, grave, important, normal, fixed, and wishlist) and forwarded to mailing lists where Debian people hang out. Within twenty-four hours I had received five e-mails telling me how to fix the problem: two from North America, two from Europe, and one from Australia. All of these e-mails gave me the same suggestion, which worked, and made my problem go away. But at the same time, a transcript of this exchange was posted to Debian's bug database, so that if other users had the same problem later, they would be able to search through and find the solution without having to enter a new, redundant bug report. Contrast this with the experience that I had when I tried to install Windows NT 4.0 on the very same machine about ten months later, in late 1997. The installation program simply stopped in the middle with no error messages. I went to the Microsoft Support website and tried to perform a search for existing help documents that would address my problem. The search engine was completely nonfunctional; it did nothing at all. It did not even give me a message telling me that it was not working. Eventually I decided that my motherboard must be at fault; it was of a slightly unusual make and model, and NT did not support as many different motherboards as Linux. I am always looking for excuses, no matter how feeble, to buy new hardware, so I bought a new motherboard that was Windows NT logo-compatible, meaning that the Windows NT logo was printed right on the box. I installed this into my computer and got Linux running right away, then attempted to install Windows NT again. Again, the installation died without any error message or explanation. By this time a couple of weeks had gone by and I thought that perhaps the search engine on the Microsoft Support website might be up and running. I gave that a try but it still didn't work. So I created a new Microsoft support account, then logged on to submit the incident. I supplied my product ID number when asked, and then began to follow the instructions on a series of help screens. In other words, I was submitting a bug report just as with the Debian bug tracking system. It's just that the interface was slicker--I was typing my complaint into little text-editing boxes on Web forms, doing it all through the GUI, whereas with Debian you send in an e-mail telegram. I knew that when I was finished submitting the bug report, it would become proprietary Microsoft information, and other users wouldn't be able to see it. Many Linux users would refuse to participate in such a scheme on ethical grounds, but I was willing to give it a shot as an experiment. In the end, though I was never able to submit my bug report, because the series of linked web pages that I was filling out eventually led me to a completely blank page: a dead end. So I went back and clicked on the buttons for \"phone support\" and eventually was given a Microsoft telephone number. When I dialed this number I got a series of piercing beeps and a recorded message from the phone company saying \"We're sorry, your call cannot be completed as dialed.\" I tried the search page again--it was still completely nonfunctional. Then I tried PPI (Pay Per Incident) again. This led me through another series of Web pages until I dead-ended at one reading: \"Notice-there is no Web page matching your request.\" I tried it again, and eventually got to a Pay Per Incident screen reading: \"OUT OF INCIDENTS. There are no unused incidents left in your account. If you would like to purchase a support incident, click OK-you will then be able to prepay for an incident....\" The cost per incident was $95. The experiment was beginning to seem rather expensive, so I gave up on the PPI approach and decided to have a go at the FAQs posted on Microsoft's website. None of the available FAQs had anything to do with my problem except for one entitled \"I am having some problems installing NT\" which appeared to have been written by flacks, not engineers. So I gave up and still, to this day, have never gotten Windows NT installed on that particular machine. For me, the path of least resistance was simply to use Debian Linux. In the world of open source software, bug reports are useful information. Making them public is a service to other users, and improves the OS. Making them public systematically is so important that highly intelligent people voluntarily put time and money into running bug databases. In the commercial OS world, however, reporting a bug is a privilege that you have to pay lots of money for. But if you pay for it, it follows that the bug report must be kept confidential--otherwise anyone could get the benefit of your ninety-five bucks! And yet nothing prevents NT users from setting up their own public bug database. This is, in other words, another feature of the OS market that simply makes no sense unless you view it in the context of culture. What Microsoft is selling through Pay Per Incident isn't technical support so much as the continued illusion that its customers are engaging in some kind of rational business transaction. It is a sort of routine maintenance fee for the upkeep of the fantasy. If people really wanted a solid OS they would use Linux, and if they really wanted tech support they would find a way to get it; Microsoft's customers want something else. As of this writing (Jan. 1999), something like 32,000 bugs have been reported to the Debian Linux bug database. Almost all of them have been fixed a long time ago. There are twelve \"critical\" bugs still outstanding, of which the oldest was posted 79 days ago. There are 20 outstanding \"grave\" bugs of which the oldest is 1166 days old. There are 48 \"important\" bugs and hundreds of \"normal\" and less important ones. Likewise, BeOS (which I'll get to in a minute) has its own bug database (http://www.be.com/developers/bugs/index.html) with its own classification system, including such categories as \"Not a Bug,\" \"Acknowledged Feature,\" and \"Will Not Fix.\" Some of the \"bugs\" here are nothing more than Be hackers blowing off steam, and are classified as \"Input Acknowledged.\" For example, I found one that was posted on December 30th, 1998. It's in the middle of a long list of bugs, wedged between one entitled \"Mouse working in very strange fashion\" and another called \"Change of BView frame does not affect, if BView not attached to a BWindow.\" This one is entitled R4: BeOS missing megalomaniacal figurehead to harness and focus developer rage and it goes like this: ---------------------------- Be Status: Input Acknowledged BeOS Version: R3.2 Component: unknown Full Description: The BeOS needs a megalomaniacal egomaniac sitting on its throne to give it a human character which everyone loves to hate. Without this, the BeOS will languish in the impersonifiable realm of OSs that people can never quite get a handle on. You can judge the success of an OS not by the quality of its features, but by how infamous and disliked the leaders behind them are. I believe this is a side-effect of developer comraderie under miserable conditions. After all, misery loves company. I believe that making the BeOS less conceptually accessible and far less reliable will require developers to band together, thus developing the kind of community where strangers talk to one- another, kind of like at a grocery store before a huge snowstorm. Following this same program, it will likely be necessary to move the BeOS headquarters to a far-less-comfortable climate. General environmental discomfort will breed this attitude within and there truly is no greater recipe for success. I would suggest Seattle, but I think it's already taken. You might try Washington, DC, but definitely not somewhere like San Diego or Tucson. ---------------------------- Unfortunately, the Be bug reporting system strips off the names of the people who report the bugs (to protect them from retribution!?) and so I don't know who wrote this. So it would appear that I'm in the middle of crowing about the technical and moral superiority of Debian Linux. But as almost always happens in the OS world, it's more complicated than that. I have Windows NT running on another machine, and the other day (Jan. 1999), when I had a problem with it, I decided to have another go at Microsoft Support. This time the search engine actually worked (though in order to reach it I had to identify myself as \"advanced\"). And instead of coughing up some useless FAQ, it located about two hundred documents (I was using very vague search criteria) that were obviously bug reports--though they were called something else. Microsoft, in other words, has got a system up and running that is functionally equivalent to Debian's bug database. It looks and feels different, of course, but it contains technical nitty-gritty and makes no bones about the existence of errors. As I've explained, selling OSes for money is a basically untenable position, and the only way Apple and Microsoft can get away with it is by pursuing technological advancements as aggressively as they can, and by getting people to believe in, and to pay for, a particular image: in the case of Apple, that of the creative free thinker, and in the case of Microsoft, that of the respectable techno-bourgeois. Just like Disney, they're making money from selling an interface, a magic mirror. It has to be polished and seamless or else the whole illusion is ruined and the business plan vanishes like a mirage. Accordingly, it was the case until recently that the people who wrote manuals and created customer support websites for commercial OSes seemed to have been barred, by their employers' legal or PR departments, from admitting, even obliquely, that the software might contain bugs or that the interface might be suffering from the blinking twelve problem. They couldn't address users' actual difficulties. The manuals and websites were therefore useless, and caused even technically self-assured users to wonder whether they were going subtly insane. When Apple engages in this sort of corporate behavior, one wants to believe that they are really trying their best. We all want to give Apple the benefit of the doubt, because mean old Bill Gates kicked the crap out of them, and because they have good PR. But when Microsoft does it, one almost cannot help becoming a paranoid conspiracist. Obviously they are hiding something from us! And yet they are so powerful! They are trying to drive us crazy! This approach to dealing with one's customers was straight out of the Central European totalitarianism of the mid-Twentieth Century. The adjectives \"Kafkaesque\" and \"Orwellian\" come to mind. It couldn't last, any more than the Berlin Wall could, and so now Microsoft has a publicly available bug database. It's called something else, and it takes a while to find it, but it's there. They have, in other words, adapted to the two-tiered Eloi/Morlock structure of technological society. If you're an Eloi you install Windows, follow the instructions, hope for the best, and dumbly suffer when it breaks. If you're a Morlock you go to the website, tell it that you are \"advanced,\" find the bug database, and get the truth straight from some anonymous Microsoft engineer. But once Microsoft has taken this step, it raises the question, once again, of whether there is any point to being in the OS business at all. Customers might be willing to pay $95 to report a problem to Microsoft if, in return, they get some advice that no other user is getting. This has the useful side effect of keeping the users alienated from one another, which helps maintain the illusion that bugs are rare aberrations. But once the results of those bug reports become openly available on the Microsoft website, everything changes. No one is going to cough up $95 to report a problem when chances are good that some other sucker will do it first, and that instructions on how to fix the bug will then show up, for free, on a public website. And as the size of the bug database grows, it eventually becomes an open admission, on Microsoft's part, that their OSes have just as many bugs as their competitors'. There is no shame in that; as I mentioned, Debian's bug database has logged 32,000 reports so far. But it puts Microsoft on an equal footing with the others and makes it a lot harder for their customers--who want to believe--to believe. MEMENTO MORI Once the Linux machine has finished spitting out its jargonic opening telegram, it prompts me to log in with a user name and a password. At this point the machine is still running the command line interface, with white letters on a black screen. There are no windows, menus, or buttons. It does not respond to the mouse; it doesn't even know that the mouse is there. It is still possible to run a lot of software at this point. Emacs, for example, exists in both a CLI and a GUI version (actually there are two GUI versions, reflecting some sort of doctrinal schism between Richard Stallman and some hackers who got fed up with him). The same is true of many other Unix programs. Many don't have a GUI at all, and many that do are capable of running from the command line. Of course, since my computer only has one monitor screen, I can only see one command line, and so you might think that I could only interact with one program at a time. But if I hold down the Alt key and then hit the F2 function button at the top of my keyboard, I am presented with a fresh, blank, black screen with a login prompt at the top of it. I can log in here and start some other program, then hit Alt-F1 and go back to the first screen, which is still doing whatever it was when I left it. Or I can do Alt-F3 and log in to a third screen, or a fourth, or a fifth. On one of these screens I might be logged in as myself, on another as root (the system administrator), on yet another I might be logged on to some other computer over the Internet. Each of these screens is called, in Unix-speak, a tty, which is an abbreviation for teletype. So when I use my Linux system in this way I am going right back to that small room at Ames High School where I first wrote code twenty-five years ago, except that a tty is quieter and faster than a teletype, and capable of running vastly superior software, such as emacs or the GNU development tools. It is easy (easy by Unix, not Apple/Microsoft standards) to configure a Linux machine so that it will go directly into a GUI when you boot it up. This way, you never see a tty screen at all. I still have mine boot into the white-on-black teletype screen however, as a computational memento mori. It used to be fashionable for a writer to keep a human skull on his desk as a reminder that he was mortal, that all about him was vanity. The tty screen reminds me that the same thing is true of slick user interfaces. The X Windows System, which is the GUI of Unix, has to be capable of running on hundreds of different video cards with different chipsets, amounts of onboard memory, and motherboard buses. Likewise, there are hundreds of different types of monitors on the new and used market, each with different specifications, and so there are probably upwards of a million different possible combinations of card and monitor. The only thing they all have in common is that they all work in VGA mode, which is the old command-line screen that you see for a few seconds when you launch Windows. So Linux always starts in VGA, with a teletype interface, because at first it has no idea what sort of hardware is attached to your computer. In order to get beyond the glass teletype and into the GUI, you have to tell Linux exactly what kinds of hardware you have. If you get it wrong, you'll get a blank screen at best, and at worst you might actually destroy your monitor by feeding it signals it can't handle. When I started using Linux this had to be done by hand. I once spent the better part of a month trying to get an oddball monitor to work for me, and filled the better part of a composition book with increasingly desperate scrawled notes. Nowadays, most Linux distributions ship with a program that automatically scans the video card and self-configures the system, so getting X Windows up and running is nearly as easy as installing an Apple/Microsoft GUI. The crucial information goes into a file (an ASCII text file, naturally) called XF86Config, which is worth looking at even if your distribution creates it for you automatically. For most people it looks like meaningless cryptic incantations, which is the whole point of looking at it. An Apple/Microsoft system needs to have the same information in order to launch its GUI, but it's apt to be deeply hidden somewhere, and it's probably in a file that can't even be opened and read by a text editor. All of the important files that make Linux systems work are right out in the open. They are always ASCII text files, so you don't need special tools to read them. You can look at them any time you want, which is good, and you can mess them up and render your system totally dysfunctional, which is not so good. At any rate, assuming that my XF86Config file is just so, I enter the command \"startx\" to launch the X Windows System. The screen blanks out for a minute, the monitor makes strange twitching noises, then reconstitutes itself as a blank gray desktop with a mouse cursor in the middle. At the same time it is launching a window manager. X Windows is pretty low-level software; it provides the infrastructure for a GUI, and it's a heavy industrial infrastructure. But it doesn't do windows. That's handled by another category of application that sits atop X Windows, called a window manager. Several of these are available, all free of course. The classic is twm (Tom's Window Manager) but there is a smaller and supposedly more efficient variant of it called fvwm, which is what I use. I have my eye on a completely different window manager called Enlightenment, which may be the hippest single technology product I have ever seen, in that (a) it is for Linux, (b) it is freeware, (c) it is being developed by a very small number of obsessed hackers, and (d) it looks amazingly cool; it is the sort of window manager that might show up in the backdrop of an Aliens movie. Anyway, the window manager acts as an intermediary between X Windows and whatever software you want to use. It draws the window frames, menus, and so on, while the applications themselves draw the actual content in the windows. The applications might be of any sort: text editors, Web browsers, graphics packages, or utility programs, such as a clock or calculator. In other words, from this point on, you feel as if you have been shunted into a parallel universe that is quite similar to the familiar Apple or Microsoft one, but slightly and pervasively different. The premier graphics program under Apple/Microsoft is Adobe Photoshop, but under Linux it's something called The GIMP. Instead of the Microsoft Office Suite, you can buy something called ApplixWare. Many commercial software packages, such as Mathematica, Netscape Communicator, and Adobe Acrobat, are available in Linux versions, and depending on how you set up your window manager you can make them look and behave just as they would under MacOS or Windows. But there is one type of window you'll see on Linux GUI that is rare or nonexistent under other OSes. These windows are called \"xterm\" and contain nothing but lines of text--this time, black text on a white background, though you can make them be different colors if you choose. Each xterm window is a separate command line interface--a tty in a window. So even when you are in full GUI mode, you can still talk to your Linux machine through a command-line interface. There are many good pieces of Unix software that do not have GUIs at all. This might be because they were developed before X Windows was available, or because the people who wrote them did not want to suffer through all the hassle of creating a GUI, or because they simply do not need one. In any event, those programs can be invoked by typing their names into the command line of an xterm window. The whoami command, mentioned earlier, is a good example. There is another called wc (\"word count\") which simply returns the number of lines, words, and characters in a text file. The ability to run these little utility programs on the command line is a great virtue of Unix, and one that is unlikely to be duplicated by pure GUI operating systems. The wc command, for example, is the sort of thing that is easy to write with a command line interface. It probably does not consist of more than a few lines of code, and a clever programmer could probably write it in a single line. In compiled form it takes up just a few bytes of disk space. But the code required to give the same program a graphical user interface would probably run into hundreds or even thousands of lines, depending on how fancy the programmer wanted to make it. Compiled into a runnable piece of software, it would have a large overhead of GUI code. It would be slow to launch and it would use up a lot of memory. This would simply not be worth the effort, and so \"wc\" would never be written as an independent program at all. Instead users would have to wait for a word count feature to appear in a commercial software package. GUIs tend to impose a large overhead on every single piece of software, even the smallest, and this overhead completely changes the programming environment. Small utility programs are no longer worth writing. Their functions, instead, tend to get swallowed up into omnibus software packages. As GUIs get more complex, and impose more and more overhead, this tendency becomes more pervasive, and the software packages grow ever more colossal; after a point they begin to merge with each other, as Microsoft Word and Excel and PowerPoint have merged into Microsoft Office: a stupendous software Wal-Mart sitting on the edge of a town filled with tiny shops that are all boarded up. It is an unfair analogy, because when a tiny shop gets boarded up it means that some small shopkeeper has lost his business. Of course nothing of the kind happens when \"wc\" becomes subsumed into one of Microsoft Word's countless menu items. The only real drawback is a loss of flexibility for the user, but it is a loss that most customers obviously do not notice or care about. The most serious drawback to the Wal-Mart approach is that most users only want or need a tiny fraction of what is contained in these giant software packages. The remainder is clutter, dead weight. And yet the user in the next cubicle over will have completely different opinions as to what is useful and what isn't. The other important thing to mention, here, is that Microsoft has included a genuinely cool feature in the Office package: a Basic programming package. Basic is the first computer language that I learned, back when I was using the paper tape and the teletype. By using the version of Basic that comes with Office you can write your own little utility programs that know how to interact with all of the little doohickeys, gewgaws, bells, and whistles in Office. Basic is easier to use than the languages typically employed in Unix command-line programming, and Office has reached many, many more people than the GNU tools. And so it is quite possible that this feature of Office will, in the end, spawn more hacking than GNU. But now I'm talking about application software, not operating systems. And as I've said, Microsoft's application software tends to be very good stuff. I don't use it very much, because I am nowhere near their target market. If Microsoft ever makes a software package that I use and like, then it really will be time to dump their stock, because I am a market segment of one. GEEK FATIGUE Over the years that I've been working with Linux I have filled three and a half notebooks logging my experiences. I only begin writing things down when I'm doing something complicated, like setting up X Windows or fooling around with my Internet connection, and so these notebooks contain only the record of my struggles and frustrations. When things are going well for me, I'll work along happily for many months without jotting down a single note. So these notebooks make for pretty bleak reading. Changing anything under Linux is a matter of opening up various of those little ASCII text files and changing a word here and a character there, in ways that are extremely significant to how the system operates. Many of the files that control how Linux operates are nothing more than command lines that became so long and complicated that not even Linux hackers could type them correctly. When working with something as powerful as Linux, you can easily devote a full half-hour to engineering a single command line. For example, the \"find\" command, which searches your file system for files that match certain criteria, is fantastically powerful and general. Its \"man\" is eleven pages long, and these are pithy pages; you could easily expand them into a whole book. And if that is not complicated enough in and of itself, you can always pipe the output of one Unix command to the input of another, equally complicated one. The \"pon\" command, which is used to fire up a PPP connection to the Internet, requires so much detailed information that it is basically impossible to launch it entirely from the command line. Instead you abstract big chunks of its input into three or four different files. You need a dialing script, which is effectively a little program telling it how to dial the phone and respond to various events; an options file, which lists up to about sixty different options on how the PPP connection is to be set up; and a secrets file, giving information about your password. Presumably there are godlike Unix hackers somewhere in the world who don't need to use these little scripts and options files as crutches, and who can simply pound out fantastically complex command lines without making typographical errors and without having to spend hours flipping through documentation. But I'm not one of them. Like almost all Linux users, I depend on having all of those details hidden away in thousands of little ASCII text files, which are in turn wedged into the recesses of the Unix filesystem. When I want to change something about the way my system works, I edit those files. I know that if I don't keep track of every little change I've made, I won't be able to get your system back in working order after I've gotten it all messed up. Keeping hand-written logs is tedious, not to mention kind of anachronistic. But it's necessary. I probably could have saved myself a lot of headaches by doing business with a company called Cygnus Support, which exists to provide assistance to users of free software. But I didn't, because I wanted to see if I could do it myself. The answer turned out to be yes, but just barely. And there are many tweaks and optimizations that I could probably make in my system that I have never gotten around to attempting, partly because I get tired of being a Morlock some days, and partly because I am afraid of fouling up a system that generally works well. Though Linux works for me and many other users, its sheer power and generality is its Achilles' heel. If you know what you are doing, you can buy a cheap PC from any computer store, throw away the Windows discs that come with it, turn it into a Linux system of mind-boggling complexity and power. You can hook it up to twelve other Linux boxes and make it into part of a parallel computer. You can configure it so that a hundred different people can be logged onto it at once over the Internet, via as many modem lines, Ethernet cards, TCP/IP sockets, and packet radio links. You can hang half a dozen different monitors off of it and play DOOM with someone in Australia while tracking communications satellites in orbit and controlling your house's lights and thermostats and streaming live video from your web-cam and surfing the Net and designing circuit boards on the other screens. But the sheer power and complexity of the system--the qualities that make it so vastly technically superior to other OSes--sometimes make it seem too formidable for routine day-to-day use. Sometimes, in other words, I just want to go to Disneyland. The ideal OS for me would be one that had a well-designed GUI that was easy to set up and use, but that included terminal windows where I could revert to the command line interface, and run GNU software, when it made sense. A few years ago, Be Inc. invented exactly that OS. It is called the BeOS. ETRE Many people in the computer business have had a difficult time grappling with Be, Incorporated, for the simple reason that nothing about it seems to make any sense whatsoever. It was launched in late 1990, which makes it roughly contemporary with Linux. From the beginning it has been devoted to creating a new operating system that is, by design, incompatible with all the others (though, as we shall see, it is compatible with Unix in some very important ways). If a definition of \"celebrity\" is someone who is famous for being famous, then Be is an anti-celebrity. It is famous for not being famous; it is famous for being doomed. But it has been doomed for an awfully long time. Be's mission might make more sense to hackers than to other people. In order to explain why I need to explain the concept of cruft, which, to people who write code, is nearly as abhorrent as unnecessary repetition. If you've been to San Francisco you may have seen older buildings that have undergone \"seismic upgrades,\" which frequently means that grotesque superstructures of modern steelwork are erected around buildings made in, say, a Classical style. When new threats arrive--if we have an Ice Age, for example--additional layers of even more high-tech stuff may be constructed, in turn, around these, until the original building is like a holy relic in a cathedral--a shard of yellowed bone enshrined in half a ton of fancy protective junk. Analogous measures can be taken to keep creaky old operating systems working. It happens all the time. Ditching an worn-out old OS ought to be simplified by the fact that, unlike old buildings, OSes have no aesthetic or cultural merit that makes them intrinsically worth saving. But it doesn't work that way in practice. If you work with a computer, you have probably customized your \"desktop,\" the environment in which you sit down to work every day, and spent a lot of money on software that works in that environment, and devoted much time to familiarizing yourself with how it all works. This takes a lot of time, and time is money. As already mentioned, the desire to have one's interactions with complex technologies simplified through the interface, and to surround yourself with virtual tchotchkes and lawn ornaments, is natural and pervasive--presumably a reaction against the complexity and formidable abstraction of the computer world. Computers give us more choices than we really want. We prefer to make those choices once, or accept the defaults handed to us by software companies, and let sleeping dogs lie. But when an OS gets changed, all the dogs jump up and start barking. The average computer user is a technological antiquarian who doesn't really like things to change. He or she is like an urban professional who has just bought a charming fixer-upper and is now moving the furniture and knicknacks around, and reorganizing the kitchen cupboards, so that everything's just right. If it is necessary for a bunch of engineers to scurry around in the basement shoring up the foundation so that it can support the new cast-iron claw-foot bathtub, and snaking new wires and pipes through the walls to supply modern appliances, why, so be it--engineers are cheap, at least when millions of OS users split the cost of their services. Likewise, computer users want to have the latest Pentium in their machines, and to be able to surf the web, without messing up all the stuff that makes them feel as if they know what the hell is going on. Sometimes this is actually possible. Adding more RAM to your system is a good example of an upgrade that is not likely to screw anything up. Alas, very few upgrades are this clean and simple. Lawrence Lessig, the whilom Special Master in the Justice Department's antitrust suit against Microsoft, complained that he had installed Internet Explorer on his computer, and in so doing, lost all of his bookmarks--his personal list of signposts that he used to navigate through the maze of the Internet. It was as if he'd bought a new set of tires for his car, and then, when pulling away from the garage, discovered that, owing to some inscrutable side-effect, every signpost and road map in the world had been destroyed. If he's like most of us, he had put a lot of work into compiling that list of bookmarks. This is only a small taste of the sort of trouble that upgrades can cause. Crappy old OSes have value in the basically negative sense that changing to new ones makes us wish we'd never been born. All of the fixing and patching that engineers must do in order to give us the benefits of new technology without forcing us to think about it, or to change our ways, produces a lot of code that, over time, turns into a giant clot of bubble gum, spackle, baling wire and duct tape surrounding every operating system. In the jargon of hackers, it is called \"cruft.\" An operating system that has many, many layers of it is described as \"crufty.\" Hackers hate to do things twice, but when they see something crufty, their first impulse is to rip it out, throw it away, and start anew. If Mark Twain were brought back to San Francisco today and dropped into one of these old seismically upgraded buildings, it would look just the same to him, with all the doors and windows in the same places--but if he stepped outside, he wouldn't recognize it. And--if he'd been brought back with his wits intact--he might question whether the building had been worth going to so much trouble to save. At some point, one must ask the question: is this really worth it, or should we maybe just tear it down and put up a good one? Should we throw another human wave of structural engineers at stabilizing the Leaning Tower of Pisa, or should we just let the damn thing fall over and build a tower that doesn't suck? Like an upgrade to an old building, cruft always seems like a good idea when the first layers of it go on--just routine maintenance, sound prudent management. This is especially true if (as it were) you never look into the cellar, or behind the drywall. But if you are a hacker who spends all his time looking at it from that point of view, cruft is fundamentally disgusting, and you can't avoid wanting to go after it with a crowbar. Or, better yet, simply walk out of the building--let the Leaning Tower of Pisa fall over--and go make a new one THAT DOESN'T LEAN. For a long time it was obvious to Apple, Microsoft, and their customers that the first generation of GUI operating systems was doomed, and that they would eventually need to be ditched and replaced with completely fresh ones. During the late Eighties and early Nineties, Apple launched a few abortive efforts to make fundamentally new post-Mac OSes such as Pink and Taligent. When those efforts failed they launched a new project called Copland which also failed. In 1997 they flirted with the idea of acquiring Be, but instead they acquired Next, which has an OS called NextStep that is, in effect, a variant of Unix. As these efforts went on, and on, and on, and failed and failed and failed, Apple's engineers, who were among the best in the business, kept layering on the cruft. They were gamely trying to turn the little toaster into a multi-tasking, Internet-savvy machine, and did an amazingly good job of it for a while--sort of like a movie hero running across a jungle river by hopping across crocodiles' backs. But in the real world you eventually run out of crocodiles, or step on a really smart one. Speaking of which, Microsoft tackled the same problem in a considerably more orderly way by creating a new OS called Windows NT, which is explicitly intended to be a direct competitor of Unix. NT stands for \"New Technology\" which might be read as an explicit rejection of cruft. And indeed, NT is reputed to be a lot less crufty than what MacOS eventually turned into; at one point the documentation needed to write code on the Mac filled something like 24 binders. Windows 95 was, and Windows 98 is, crufty because they have to be backward-compatible with older Microsoft OSes. Linux deals with the cruft problem in the same way that Eskimos supposedly dealt with senior citizens: if you insist on using old versions of Linux software, you will sooner or later find yourself drifting through the Bering Straits on a dwindling ice floe. They can get away with this because most of the software is free, so it costs nothing to download up-to-date versions, and because most Linux users are Morlocks. The great idea behind BeOS was to start from a clean sheet of paper and design an OS the right way. And that is exactly what they did. This was obviously a good idea from an aesthetic standpoint, but does not a sound business plan make. Some people I know in the GNU/Linux world are annoyed with Be for going off on this quixotic adventure when their formidable skills could have been put to work helping to promulgate Linux. Indeed, none of it makes sense until you remember that the founder of the company, Jean-Louis Gassee, is from France--a country that for many years maintained its own separate and independent version of the English monarchy at a court in St. Germaines, complete with courtiers, coronation ceremonies, a state religion and a foreign policy. Now, the same annoying yet admirable stiff-neckedness that gave us the Jacobites, the force de frappe, Airbus, and ARRET signs in Quebec, has brought us a really cool operating system. I fart in your general direction, Anglo-Saxon pig-dogs! To create an entirely new OS from scratch, just because none of the existing ones was exactly right, struck me as an act of such colossal nerve that I felt compelled to support it. I bought a BeBox as soon as I could. The BeBox was a dual-processor machine, powered by Motorola chips, made specifically to run the BeOS; it could not run any other operating system. That's why I bought it. I felt it was a way to burn my bridges. Its most distinctive feature is two columns of LEDs on the front panel that zip up and down like tachometers to convey a sense of how hard each processor is working. I thought it looked cool, and besides, I reckoned that when the company went out of business in a few months, my BeBox would be a valuable collector's item. Now it is about two years later and I am typing this on my BeBox. The LEDs (Das Blinkenlights, as they are called in the Be community) flash merrily next to my right elbow as I hit the keys. Be, Inc. is still in business, though they stopped making BeBoxes almost immediately after I bought mine. They made the sad, but probably quite wise decision that hardware was a sucker's game, and ported the BeOS to Macintoshes and Mac clones. Since these used the same sort of Motorola chips that powered the BeBox, this wasn't especially hard. Very soon afterwards, Apple strangled the Mac-clone makers and restored its hardware monopoly. So, for a while, the only new machines that could run BeOS were made by Apple. By this point Be, like Spiderman with his Spider-sense, had developed a keen sense of when they were about to get crushed like a bug. Even if they hadn't, the notion of being dependent on Apple--so frail and yet so vicious--for their continued existence should have put a fright into anyone. Now engaged in their own crocodile-hopping adventure, they ported the BeOS to Intel chips--the same chips used in Windows machines. And not a moment too soon, for when Apple came out with its new top-of-the-line hardware, based on the Motorola G3 chip, they withheld the technical data that Be's engineers would need to make the BeOS run on those machines. This would have killed Be, just like a slug between the eyes, if they hadn't made the jump to Intel. So now BeOS runs on an assortment of hardware that is almost incredibly motley: BeBoxes, aging Macs and Mac orphan-clones, and Intel machines that are intended to be used for Windows. Of course the latter type are ubiquitous and shockingly cheap nowadays, so it would appear that Be's hardware troubles are finally over. Some German hackers have even come up with a Das Blinkenlights replacement: it's a circuit board kit that you can plug into PC-compatible machines running BeOS. It gives you the zooming LED tachometers that were such a popular feature of the BeBox. My BeBox is already showing its age, as all computers do after a couple of years, and sooner or later I'll probably have to replace it with an Intel machine. Even after that, though, I will still be able to use it. Because, inevitably, someone has now ported Linux to the BeBox. At any rate, BeOS has an extremely well-thought-out GUI built on a technological framework that is solid. It is based from the ground up on modern object-oriented software principles. BeOS software consists of quasi-independent software entities called objects, which communicate by sending messages to each other. The OS itself is made up of such objects, and serves as a kind of post office or Internet that routes messages to and fro, from object to object. The OS is multi-threaded, which means that like all other modern OSes it can walk and chew gum at the same time; but it gives programmers a lot of power over spawning and terminating threads, or independent sub-processes. It is also a multi-processing OS, which means that it is inherently good at running on computers that have more than one CPU (Linux and Windows NT can also do this proficiently). For this user, a big selling point of BeOS is the built-in Terminal application, which enables you to open up windows that are equivalent to the xterm windows in Linux. In other words, the command line interface is available if you want it. And because BeOS hews to a certain standard called POSIX, it is capable of running most of the GNU software. That is to say that the vast array of command-line software developed by the GNU crowd will work in BeOS terminal windows without complaint. This includes the GNU development tools-the compiler and linker. And it includes all of the handy little utility programs. I'm writing this using a modern sort of user-friendly text editor called Pe, written by a Dutchman named Maarten Hekkelman, but when I want to find out how long it is, I jump to a terminal window and run \"wc.\" As is suggested by the sample bug report I quoted earlier, people who work for Be, and developers who write code for BeOS, seem to be enjoying themselves more than their counterparts in other OSes. They also seem to be a more diverse lot in general. A couple of years ago I went to an auditorium at a local university to see some representatives of Be put on a dog-and-pony show. I went because I assumed that the place would be empty and echoing, and I felt that they deserved an audience of at least one. In fact, I ended up standing in an aisle, for hundreds of students had packed the place. It was like a rock concert. One of the two Be engineers on the stage was a black man, which unfortunately is a very odd thing in the high-tech world. The other made a ringing denunciation of cruft, and extolled BeOS for its cruft-free qualities, and actually came out and said that in ten or fifteen years, when BeOS had become all crufty like MacOS and Windows 95, it would be time to simply throw it away and create a new OS from scratch. I doubt that this is an official Be, Inc. policy, but it sure made a big impression on everyone in the room! During the late Eighties, the MacOS was, for a time, the OS of cool people-artists and creative-minded hackers-and BeOS seems to have the potential to attract the same crowd now. Be mailing lists are crowded with hackers with names like Vladimir and Olaf and Pierre, sending flames to each other in fractured techno-English. The only real question about BeOS is whether or not it is doomed. Of late, Be has responded to the tiresome accusation that they are doomed with the assertion that BeOS is \"a media operating system\" made for media content creators, and hence is not really in competition with Windows at all. This is a little bit disingenuous. To go back to the car dealership analogy, it is like the Batmobile dealer claiming that he is not really in competition with the others because his car can go three times as fast as theirs and is also capable of flying. Be has an office in Paris, and, as mentioned, the conversation on Be mailing lists has a strongly European flavor. At the same time they have made strenuous efforts to find a niche in Japan, and Hitachi has recently begun bundling BeOS with their PCs. So if I had to make wild guess I'd say that they are playing Go while Microsoft is playing chess. They are staying clear, for now, of Microsoft's overwhelmingly strong position in North America. They are trying to get themselves established around the edges of the board, as it were, in Europe and Japan, where people may be more open to alternative OSes, or at least more hostile to Microsoft, than they are in the United States. What holds Be back in this country is that the smart people are afraid to look like suckers. You run the risk of looking naive when you say \"I've tried the BeOS and here's what I think of it.\" It seems much more sophisticated to say \"Be's chances of carving out a new niche in the highly competitive OS market are close to nil.\" It is, in techno-speak, a problem of mindshare. And in the OS business, mindshare is more than just a PR issue; it has direct effects on the technology itself. All of the peripheral gizmos that can be hung off of a personal computer--the printers, scanners, PalmPilot interfaces, and Lego Mindstorms--require pieces of software called drivers. Likewise, video cards and (to a lesser extent) monitors need drivers. Even the different types of motherboards on the market relate to the OS in different ways, and separate code is required for each one. All of this hardware-specific code must not only written but also tested, debugged, upgraded, maintained, and supported. Because the hardware market has become so vast and complicated, what really determines an OS's fate is not how good the OS is technically, or how much it costs, but rather the availability of hardware-specific code. Linux hackers have to write that code themselves, and they have done an amazingly good job of keeping up to speed. Be, Inc. has to write all their own drivers, though as BeOS has begun gathering momentum, third-party developers have begun to contribute drivers, which are available on Be's web site. But Microsoft owns the high ground at the moment, because it doesn't have to write its own drivers. Any hardware maker bringing a new video card or peripheral device to market today knows that it will be unsalable unless it comes with the hardware-specific code that will make it work under Windows, and so each hardware maker has accepted the burden of creating and maintaining its own library of drivers. MINDSHARE The U.S. Government's assertion that Microsoft has a monopoly in the OS market might be the most patently absurd claim ever advanced by the legal mind. Linux, a technically superior operating system, is being given away for free, and BeOS is available at a nominal price. This is simply a fact, which has to be accepted whether or not you like Microsoft. Microsoft is really big and rich, and if some of the government's witnesses are to be believed, they are not nice guys. But the accusation of a monopoly simply does not make any sense. What is really going on is that Microsoft has seized, for the time being, a certain type of high ground: they dominate in the competition for mindshare, and so any hardware or software maker who wants to be taken seriously feels compelled to make a product that is compatible with their operating systems. Since Windows-compatible drivers get written by the hardware makers, Microsoft doesn't have to write them; in effect, the hardware makers are adding new components to Windows, making it a more capable OS, without charging Microsoft for the service. It is a very good position to be in. The only way to fight such an opponent is to have an army of highly competetent coders who write equivalent drivers for free, which Linux does. But possession of this psychological high ground is different from a monopoly in any normal sense of that word, because here the dominance has nothing to do with technical performance or price. The old robber-baron monopolies were monopolies because they physically controlled means of production and/or distribution. But in the software business, the means of production is hackers typing code, and the means of distribution is the Internet, and no one is claiming that Microsoft controls those. Here, instead, the dominance is inside the minds of people who buy software. Microsoft has power because people believe it does. This power is very real. It makes lots of money. Judging from recent legal proceedings in both Washingtons, it would appear that this power and this money have inspired some very peculiar executives to come out and work for Microsoft, and that Bill Gates should have administered saliva tests to some of them before issuing them Microsoft ID cards. But this is not the sort of power that fits any normal definition of the word \"monopoly,\" and it's not amenable to a legal fix. The courts may order Microsoft to do things differently. They might even split the company up. But they can't really do anything about a mindshare monopoly, short of taking every man, woman, and child in the developed world and subjecting them to a lengthy brainwashing procedure. Mindshare dominance is, in other words, a really odd sort of beast, something that the framers of our antitrust laws couldn't possibly have imagined. It looks like one of these modern, wacky chaos-theory phenomena, a complexity thing, in which a whole lot of independent but connected entities (the world's computer users), making decisions on their own, according to a few simple rules of thumb, generate a large phenomenon (total domination of the market by one company) that cannot be made sense of through any kind of rational analysis. Such phenomena are fraught with concealed tipping-points and all a-tangle with bizarre feedback loops, and cannot be understood; people who try, end up (a) going crazy, (b) giving up, (c) forming crackpot theories, or (d) becoming high-paid chaos theory consultants. Now, there might be one or two people at Microsoft who are dense enough to believe that mindshare dominance is some kind of stable and enduring position. Maybe that even accounts for some of the weirdos they've hired in the pure-business end of the operation, the zealots who keep getting hauled into court by enraged judges. But most of them must have the wit to understand that phenomena like these are maddeningly unstable, and that there's no telling what weird, seemingly inconsequential event might cause the system to shift into a radically different configuration. To put it another way, Microsoft can be confident that Thomas Penfield Jackson will not hand down an order that the brains of everyone in the developed world are to be summarily re-programmed. But there's no way to predict when people will decide, en masse, to re-program their own brains. This might explain some of Microsoft's behavior, such as their policy of keeping eerily large reserves of cash sitting around, and the extreme anxiety that they display whenever something like Java comes along. I have never seen the inside of the building at Microsoft where the top executives hang out, but I have this fantasy that in the hallways, at regular intervals, big red alarm boxes are bolted to the wall. Each contains a large red button protected by a windowpane. A metal hammer dangles on a chain next to it. Above is a big sign reading: IN THE EVENT OF A CRASH IN MARKET SHARE, BREAK GLASS. What happens when someone shatters the glass and hits the button, I don't know, but it sure would be interesting to find out. One imagines banks collapsing all over the world as Microsoft withdraws its cash reserves, and shrink-wrapped pallet-loads of hundred-dollar bills dropping from the skies. No doubt, Microsoft has a plan. But what I would really like to know is whether, at some level, their programmers might heave a big sigh of relief if the burden of writing the One Universal Interface to Everything were suddenly lifted from their shoulders. THE RIGHT PINKY OF GOD In his book The Life of the Cosmos, which everyone should read, Lee Smolin gives the best description I've ever read of how our universe emerged from an uncannily precise balancing of different fundamental constants. The mass of the proton, the strength of gravity, the range of the weak nuclear force, and a few dozen other fundamental constants completely determine what sort of universe will emerge from a Big Bang. If these values had been even slightly different, the universe would have been a vast ocean of tepid gas or a hot knot of plasma or some other basically uninteresting thing--a dud, in other words. The only way to get a universe that's not a dud--that has stars, heavy elements, planets, and life--is to get the basic numbers just right. If there were some machine, somewhere, that could spit out universes with randomly chosen values for their fundamental constants, then for every universe like ours it would produce 10^229 duds. Though I haven't sat down and run the numbers on it, to me this seems comparable to the probability of making a Unix computer do something useful by logging into a tty and typing in command lines when you have forgotten all of the little options and keywords. Every time your right pinky slams that ENTER key, you are making another try. In some cases the operating system does nothing. In other cases it wipes out all of your files. In most cases it just gives you an error message. In other words, you get many duds. But sometimes, if you have it all just right, the computer grinds away for a while and then produces something like emacs. It actually generates complexity, which is Smolin's criterion for interestingness. Not only that, but it's beginning to look as if, once you get below a certain size--way below the level of quarks, down into the realm of string theory--the universe can't be described very well by physics as it has been practiced since the days of Newton. If you look at a small enough scale, you see processes that look almost computational in nature. I think that the message is very clear here: somewhere outside of and beyond our universe is an operating system, coded up over incalculable spans of time by some kind of hacker-demiurge. The cosmic operating system uses a command-line interface. It runs on something like a teletype, with lots of noise and heat; punched-out bits flutter down into its hopper like drifting stars. The demiurge sits at his teletype, pounding out one command line after another, specifying the values of fundamental constants of physics: universe -G 6.672e-11 -e 1.602e-19 -h 6.626e-34 -protonmass 1.673e-27.... and when he's finished typing out the command line, his right pinky hesitates above the ENTER key for an aeon or two, wondering what's going to happen; then down it comes--and the WHACK you hear is another Big Bang. Now THAT is a cool operating system, and if such a thing were actually made available on the Internet (for free, of course) every hacker in the world would download it right away and then stay up all night long messing with it, spitting out universes right and left. Most of them would be pretty dull universes but some of them would be simply amazing. Because what those hackers would be aiming for would be much more ambitious than a universe that had a few stars and galaxies in it. Any run-of-the-mill hacker would be able to do that. No, the way to gain a towering reputation on the Internet would be to get so good at tweaking your command line that your universes would spontaneously develop life. And once the way to do that became common knowledge, those hackers would move on, trying to make their universes develop the right kind of life, trying to find the one change in the Nth decimal place of some physical constant that would give us an Earth in which, say, Hitler had been accepted into art school after all, and had ended up his days as a street artist with cranky political opinions. Even if that fantasy came true, though, most users (including myself, on certain days) wouldn't want to bother learning to use all of those arcane commands, and struggling with all of the failures; a few dud universes can really clutter up your basement. After we'd spent a while pounding out command lines and hitting that ENTER key and spawning dull, failed universes, we would start to long for an OS that would go all the way to the opposite extreme: an OS that had the power to do everything--to live our life for us. In this OS, all of the possible decisions we could ever want to make would have been anticipated by clever programmers, and condensed into a series of dialog boxes. By clicking on radio buttons we could choose from among mutually exclusive choices (HETEROSEXUAL/HOMOSEXUAL). Columns of check boxes would enable us to select the things that we wanted in our life (GET MARRIED/WRITE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL) and for more complicated options we could fill in little text boxes (NUMBER OF DAUGHTERS: NUMBER OF SONS:). Even this user interface would begin to look awfully complicated after a while, with so many choices, and so many hidden interactions between choices. It could become damn near unmanageable--the blinking twelve problem all over again. The people who brought us this operating system would have to provide templates and wizards, giving us a few default lives that we could use as starting places for designing our own. Chances are that these default lives would actually look pretty damn good to most people, good enough, anyway, that they'd be reluctant to tear them open and mess around with them for fear of making them worse. So after a few releases the software would begin to look even simpler: you would boot it up and it would present you with a dialog box with a single large button in the middle labeled: LIVE. Once you had clicked that button, your life would begin. If anything got out of whack, or failed to meet your expectations, you could complain about it to Microsoft's Customer Support Department. If you got a flack on the line, he or she would tell you that your life was actually fine, that there was not a thing wrong with it, and in any event it would be a lot better after the next upgrade was rolled out. But if you persisted, and identified yourself as Advanced, you might get through to an actual engineer. What would the engineer say, after you had explained your problem, and enumerated all of the dissatisfactions in your life? He would probably tell you that life is a very hard and complicated thing; that no interface can change that; that anyone who believes otherwise is a sucker; and that if you don't like having choices made for you, you should start making your own.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs81n/images/spacer.gif) | ![Cryptonomincon by Neal<br>Stephenson](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs81n/images/main_banner.gif) |     |\n\n-----\nGenerate comments in a hierarchical structure with 3 comments per level, up to a depth of 3."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n- **mxwsn** (): This essay by Neal Stephenson was first published in 1999. \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;In_the_Beginning..._Was_the_Command_Line\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;In_the_Beginning..._Was_the_...</a><p>The analogy of OS as cars (Windows is a station wagon, Linux is a tank) is brought up in the recent Acquired episode on Microsoft, where Vista was a Dodge Viper but Windows 7 was a Toyota Camry, which is what users actually wanted.\n  - **GrumpyYoungMan** (): And Neal Stephenson acknowledged it was obsolete in 2004:<p>&quot;<i>I embraced OS X as soon as it was available and have never looked back. So a lot of &#x27;In the beginning was the command line&#x27; is now obsolete.

He couldn&#x27;t take advantage of the freedoms it provided and it worked the same for him as any proprietary OS would. I.E. he had the excuse that programming is hard, a specialty that requires much practice. This is an ongoing issue with free software and is why it is niche... it primarily appeals to software developers as they are the only ones that can take advantage of the freedoms it provides and are the ones that truly sacrifice that freedom when they use a non-free OS.\n    - **llm_trw** (): Given what OS X has become it&#x27;s un-obsoleted itself again.<p>It&#x27;s kind of ironic that you&#x27;re using a post from 20 years ago to invalidate an essay from 25 years ago, about an OS that&#x27;s been substantially dumbed down in the last 10 years.<p>Bad corporate blood will tell.\n    - **theandrewbailey** (): &gt; There was a competing bicycle dealership next door (Apple) that one day began selling motorized vehicles--expensive but attractively styled cars with their innards hermetically sealed, so that how they worked was something of a mystery.<p>Neal said the essay was quickly obsolete, especially in regards to Mac, but I&#x27;ll always remember this reference about hermetically sealed Apple products. To this day, Apple doesn&#x27;t want anyone to know how their products work, or how to fix them, to the point where upgrading or expanding internal hardware is mostly impossible.\n  - **simonmysun** (): I feel now the different way. Linux is never that much more powerful than other OS. It felt more like a tractor 10 years ago and now it is a good alternative to &quot;Toyota Camry&quot; with pretty good user experience.<p>Meanwhile Windows has become those cars with two 27&quot; screen as dashboard, which has bad user experience and full of advertisements.\n  - **hiAndrewQuinn** (): Windows XP would probably be an old 1970s Volvo that is still, somehow, running in all kinds of places otherwise forgotten by the waking world.\n    - **homarp** (): like <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osnews.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;140301&#x2F;no-southwest-airlines-is-not-still-using-windows-3-1&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osnews.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;140301&#x2F;no-southwest-airlines-is...</a> :)\n    - **johnohara** (): Mostly in Oregon, Northern CA, and parts of Washington. But parts are increasingly hard to find.\n    - **heraldgeezer** (): OS&#x2F;2 also! :D\n- **ndsipa_pomu** (): One major advantage of the CLI is that instructions&#x2F;fixes etc are very concise and can be easily communicated. If someone has a Linux system that needs a known fix, then it&#x27;s trivial to send someone the commands to copy&#x2F;paste into a terminal. However, if there&#x27;s a known fix for a graphical program, then it suddenly becomes much harder to communicate - do you go for a textual instruction (e.g. click on the hamburger menu, then choose &quot;preferences&quot;...), or a series of screenshots along with some text?\n  - **anthomtb** (): I think your trailing question is a hypothetical but to answer:<p>Screenshots along with text, then use Microsoft Paint to mark up the screen shots. For example, circling the appropriate menu option in a thick red line. Sadly, I do not know how to graphically convey the double-click operation.<p>Its a time consuming and error prone process, best used if the buggy GUI application is abandonware. Otherwise, the new version will have the same bug or non-intuitive process but the GUI will be unrecognizable. Probably because some manager, somewhere, read too many HN articles and decided a user-facing refactor was the most important thing they could possibly do.\n    - **ndsipa_pomu** (): You raise a good point about GUIs changing over time. Obviously, CLIs can change, but that happens less often and is usually in response to a poorly thought out first attempt at providing functionality (or when additional functionality is bolted on).\n  - **kjkjadksj** (): Not only is it good for sharing but for automating functions in script. Imagine managing an IT environment where you have to click around the gui for each and every workstation, versus what these IT professionals actually do which is write a configuration script that does all their setup functions, which they can push to all networked workstations from their office with a single keystroke.<p>To do that in a gui-centric fashion, the only tools we actually have are textual commands that direct gui action. essentially its a middleman step: if we are already writing our applescript lets say, we might as well just abrogate the actual commands that our applescript is trying to abrogate through the gui system.\n  - **K2h** (): On windows, steps recorder can be useful. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows&#x2F;record-steps-to-reproduce-a-problem-46582a9b-620f-2e36-00c9-04e25d784e47\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows&#x2F;record-steps-to-...</a>\n- **xg15** (): &gt; <i>Buyer: &quot;But this dealership has mechanics on staff. If something goes wrong with my station wagon, I can take a day off work, bring it here, and pay them to work on it while I sit in the waiting room for hours, listening to elevator music.&quot;<p>Bullhorn: &quot;But if you accept one of our free tanks we will send volunteers to your house to fix it for free while you sleep!&quot;</i><p>Did Linux distros actually offer support at some point? (By what I assume would be some project contributor ssh-ing into your machine)<p>My impression was always the arguments were more like &quot;Well yes, but we have this literal building full of technical manuals that describe every bolt and screw of your tank - and we can give you a copy of all of them for free! And think about it - after you have taken some modest effort to read and learn all of them by heart, you&#x27;ll be able to fix and even modify your tank all on your own! No more dependence on crooked car dealers! And if you need help, we have monthly community meetups you can attend and talk with people just as tank-crazy as you are! (please only attend if you&#x27;re sufficiently tank-crazy, and PLEASE only after you read the manuals)&quot;<p>(This was decades ago, the situation has gotten significantly better today)\n  - **bregma** (): &gt; Did Linux distros actually offer support at some point?<p>Ever wonder how Red Hat became a billion-dollar company before it was bought by IBM, and now makes up a huge segment of IBM&#x27;s revenue stream?<p>Have you noticed SuSE is still around?<p>Have you ever speculated on how Canonical keeps its lights on?<p>Paid support, my naive friend. Linux support is big business and is what keeps the popular distros alive.\n    - **matheusmoreira** (): Arch Linux seems to be an exception.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.archlinux.org&#x2F;title&#x2F;Arch_Linux\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.archlinux.org&#x2F;title&#x2F;Arch_Linux</a><p>&gt; Arch developers remain unpaid, part-time volunteers, and there are no prospects for monetizing Arch Linux\n    - **xg15** (): Good point!\n  - **delusional** (): &gt; Did Linux distros actually offer support at some point? (By what I assume would be some project contributor ssh-ing into your machine)<p>I don&#x27;t think that was the intended implication. I think the analogy is more akin to: &quot;If send us a bug report, we&#x27;ll fix it and ship a new version that you can download and use for free.&quot; In the olden days, you&#x27;d have to buy a new version of commercial software if it didn&#x27;t work for your machine, complementary patches were rare.\n    - **jmclnx** (): Depends on where you lived.  In the early days there were lots of LUGs in some areas, usually in college areas, but some would be hosted at a few Companies.<p>I think DEC had one or two.  And you could find someone who would meet you somewhere to help you out, it was an exciting time.  Also there were lots of install fests for Linux.<p>Most activity took place on USENET, so getting help was rather easy.<p>For example, I had asked how I could connect 2 monitors to my 386SX, one controlled by a VGA card, the other via a mono-card, each monitor with a couple of VTs.  That was doable with Coherent on install.  A day later I got a patch.<p>Things moved very quickly back then :)\n  - **lukan** (): &quot;By what I assume would be some project contributor ssh-ing into your machine&quot;<p>Who would want that?<p>&quot;Stay away from my house, you freak!&quot; would be the normal reaction.\nUnless some serious trust is developed, I would not let people into my house while I sleep.<p>Also the actual usual reaction would have been more like: &quot;hey it is open source, you can fix anything on your tank yourself&quot;<p>You need a new module to connect with your other devices, just build it yourself, no big deal!\n    - **xg15** (): I know you shouldn&#x27;t look too closely at analogies, but I think there is an interesting inconsistency in the &quot;car dealerships&quot; story:<p>The tank people offer to send someone to look into the <i>car</i> (rsp. tank) but the buyer rejects them from entering their <i>house</i>.<p>That&#x27;s significant, because a car is much less private than a house. In the real world, if my car had an issue, it would be perfectly reasonable to give it into the hands of a mechanic, even if I don&#x27;t know them personally. (And evidently the reputation of the dealership isn&#x27;t the deciding factor either, otherwise all the independent repair shops wouldn&#x27;t exist)<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;d be much more wary to let strangers into my <i>house</i> without supervision, because I have far more private and valuable possessions there than in my car.<p>So the question is whether computers are more like cars or like houses. I&#x27;d argue, they sort of blur the line and have definitely moved closer to &quot;house&quot; in the last decades. But it might have been different back then.\n    - **heraldgeezer** (): Companies want that when prod stops.\n"}]}

globals())\n```\n\nNow you can use `wat` object.\n\nWarning\n\nBefore executing Insta-Load snippet, it's recommended to verify what you're about to run. If you feel uncomfortable, you can either:\n\n*   Verify what's inside the extracted code beforehand:\n    \n    ```python\n    print(zlib.decompress(base64.b64decode(code)).decode())\n    ```\n    \n*   Paste the content of [inspection.py](https://github.com/igrek51/wat/blob/master/wat/inspection/inspection.py)\n     into your interpreter. It has the same effect.\n*   [Install package with pip](#install-with-pip)\n     and review the code.\n\n### Install with pip\n\n[](#install-with-pip)\n\nAlternatively, install **wat-inspector** package and import inspection tool from **wat** module:\n\n```shell\npip install wat-inspector\n```\n\n```python\nimport wat\n```\n\nUsage & modifiers\n-----------------\n\n[](#usage--modifiers)\n\n`wat` object can quickly inspect things by using the division operator (for faster typing without parentheses). A short syntax `wat / object` is equivalent to `wat(object)`.\n\nYou can call `wat.modifiers / object` with the following **modifiers**:\n\n*   `.short` or `.s` to hide attributes (variables and methods)\n*   `.long` to show non-abbreviated values and documentation\n*   `.dunder` to display dunder attributes\n*   `.code` to reveal the source code of a function, method, or class\n*   `.nodocs` to hide documentation for functions and classes\n*   `.all` to include all available information\n*   `.ret` to return the inspected object\n*   `.str` to return the output string instead of printing\n\nYou can chain modifiers, e.g. `wat.long.dunder.nodocs / object`.\n\nCall `wat.locals` or `wat()` to inspect `locals()` variables.  \nCall `wat.globals` to inspect `globals()` variables.\n\nType `wat` in the interpreter to learn more about this object itself.\n\nThere are several alternative syntaxes that are equivalent. Choose the one that works best for you:\n\n```python\nwat.short / 'foo'  # fast typing\nwat.short('foo')\nwat('foo', short=True)  # natural Python syntax\n'foo' | wat.short  # similar to piping in Unix\n```\n\nUse Cases Examples\n------------------\n\n[](#use-cases-examples)\n\n### Determine type\n\n[](#determine-type)\n\nIn a dynamic typing language like Python, it's often hard to determine the type of an object. WAT Inspector can help you with that by showing the name of the type with the module it comes from.\n\n```python\n>>> wat.short / (1,)\nvalue: (1,)\ntype: tuple\nlen: 1\n```\n\n```python\n>>> wat.short / {None}\nvalue: {None}\ntype: set\nlen: 1\n```\n\n```python\n>>> wat.short / user\nstr: admin\nrepr: <User: admin>\ntype: django.contrib.auth.models.User\nparents: django.contrib.auth.models.AbstractUser, django.contrib.auth.base_user.AbstractBaseUser, django.contrib.auth.models.PermissionsMixin, django.db.models.base.Model, django.db.models.utils.AltersData\n```\n\n[![](https://github.com/igrek51/wat/raw/master/docs/img/wat-short-types.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/igrek51/wat/blob/master/docs/img/wat-short-types.png?raw=true)\n\nNow that you've identified the actual type, you can put the type annotations in your code to reduce the confusion.\n\n### Look up methods\n\n[](#look-up-methods)\n\nListing methods, functions and looking up their signature is extremely beneficial to see how to use them. Plus, you can read their docstrings.\n\n```python\nwat / 'stringy'\n```\n\n[![](https://github.com/igrek51/wat/raw/master/docs/img/wat-string.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/igrek51/wat/blob/master/docs/img/wat-string.png?raw=true)\n\n[![](https://github.com/igrek51/wat/raw/master/docs/img/wat-intro-set.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/igrek51/wat/blob/master/docs/img/wat-intro-set.png?raw=true)\n\nUse `wat.long` if you want to see full doscstrings.\n\n### Discover function's signature\n\n[](#discover-functions-signature)\n\nSee the docstrings and the signature of a function or a method to see how to use it.\n\n```python\nwat / str.split\n```\n\n[![](https://github.com/igrek51/wat/raw/master/docs/img/wat-str-split.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/igrek51/wat/blob/master/docs/img/wat-str-split.png?raw=true)\n\n### Look up attributes\n\n[](#look-up-attributes)\n\nList the attribues and their types to see what's really inside the inspected object.\n\n```python\nwat / re.match('(\\d)_(.*)', '1_title')\n```\n\n[![](https://github.com/igrek51/wat/raw/master/docs/img/wat-re-match.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/igrek51/wat/blob/master/docs/img/wat-re-match.png?raw=true)\n\n### Explore modules\n\n[](#explore-modules)\n\nOne of the use cases is to explore modules. For instance you can list functions, classes and the sub-modules of a selected module.\n\n```python\nimport pathlib\nwat / pathlib\n```\n\n[![](https://github.com/igrek51/wat/raw/master/docs/img/wat-pathlib.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/igrek51/wat/blob/master/docs/img/wat-pathlib.png?raw=true)\n\nThen, you can navigate further, e.g. `wat / pathlib.fnmatch`.\n\n### Explore dunder attributes\n\n[](#explore-dunder-attributes)\n\nBy default, WAT Inspector hides attributes starting with `__`. Use `wat.dunder` to see them.\n\n```python\nwat.dunder / {}\n```\n\n[![](https://github.com/igrek51/wat/raw/master/docs/img/wat-dict-dunder.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/igrek51/wat/blob/master/docs/img/wat-dict-dunder.png?raw=true)\n\n### Review the code\n\n[](#review-the-code)\n\nLook up the source code of a function to see how it really works.\n\n```python\nimport re\nwat.code / re.match\n```\n\n[![](https://github.com/igrek51/wat/raw/master/docs/img/wat-code-rematch.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/igrek51/wat/blob/master/docs/img/wat-code-rematch.png?raw=true)\n\n### Debug with breakpoint\n\n[](#debug-with-breakpoint)\n\nYou can use Python's `breakpoint()` keyword to launch an interactive debugger in your program:\n\n```python\nlogger.debug('init')\nx = {'what is it?'}\nbreakpoint()\nlogger.debug('done')\n```\n\n```python\n(Pdb) import wat  # or paste insta-load snippet\n(Pdb) wat / x  # inspect local variable\n...\n(Pdb) c  # continue execution\n```\n\n### Explore Python built-ins\n\n[](#explore-python-built-ins)\n\n```python\nwat / __builtins__\n```\n\n### Look up local variables\n\n[](#look-up-local-variables)\n\n```python\nwat()\n# or\nwat.locals\n```\n\n### Look up global variables\n\n[](#look-up-global-variables)\n\n```python\nwat.globals\n```\n\nEnvironment variables\n---------------------\n\n[](#environment-variables)\n\n*   `WAT_COLOR=\"false\"` to disable colorful output in the console.\n*   `WAT_COLOR=\"true\"` to enforce colorful outputs even in non-tty environment.\n\nAbout\n-----\n\nDeep inspection of Python objects\n\n[igrek51.github.io/wat/](https://igrek51.github.io/wat/ \"https://igrek51.github.io/wat/\")\n\n### Topics\n\n[python](/topics/python \"Topic: python\")\n [inspector](/topics/inspector \"Topic: inspector\")\n [python-inspect](/topics/python-inspect \"Topic: python-inspect\")\n\n### Resources\n\n[Readme](#readme-ov-file)\n\n### License\n\n[MIT license](#MIT-1-ov-file)\n\n[Activity](/igrek51/wat/activity)\n\n### Stars\n\n[**1k** stars](/igrek51/wat/stargazers)\n\n### Watchers\n\n[**6** watching](/igrek51/wat/watchers)\n\n### Forks\n\n[**16** forks](/igrek51/wat/forks)\n\n[Report repository](/contact/report-content?content_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Figrek51%2Fwat&report=igrek51+%28user%29)\n\n[Releases](/igrek51/wat/releases)\n\n----------------------------------\n\n[4 tags](/igrek51/wat/tags)\n\n[Contributors 7](/igrek51/wat/graphs/contributors)\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n*   [![@igrek51](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12595017?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/igrek51)\n    \n*   [![@STKFLT](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10453283?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/STKFLT)\n    \n*   [![@thiswillbeyourgithub](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26625900?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/thiswillbeyourgithub)\n    \n*   [![@franciscod](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/726447?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/franciscod)\n    \n*   [![@Zirak](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144615?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/Zirak)\n    \n*   [![@flyaroundme](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1743477?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/flyaroundme)\n    \n*   [![@SpecificProtagonist](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30270112?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/SpecificProtagonist)\n    \n\nLanguages\n---------\n\n*   [Python 97.0%](/igrek51/wat/search?l=python)\n    \n*   [Makefile 3.0%](/igrek51/wat/search?l=makefile)\n    \n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n-----\nGenerate comments in a hierarchical structure with 3 comments per level, up to a depth of 3."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n- **skeledrew** (): Waaat :D.

As the Linux kernel evolved, Ori\u2019s availability to maintain the document diminished. Consequently, Peter Jay Salzman assumed the role of maintainer and updated the guide for Linux v2.4. Similar constraints arose for Peter when tracking developments in Linux v2.6, leading to Michael Burian joining as a co-maintainer to bring the guide up to speed with Linux v2.6. Bob Mottram contributed to the guide by updating examples for Linux v3.8 and later. Jim Huang then undertook the task of updating the guide for recent Linux versions (v5.0 and beyond), along with revising the LaTeX document.\n\n#### 1.2 Acknowledgements\n\nThe following people have contributed corrections or good suggestions:\n\nAmit Dhingra, Andy Shevchenko, Arush Sharma, Benno Bielmeier, Bob Lee, Brad Baker, Che-Chia Chang, Cheng-Shian Yeh, Chih-En Lin, Chih-Hsuan Yang, Chih-Yu Chen, Ching-Hua (Vivian) Lin, Chin Yik Ming, cvvletter, Cyril Brulebois, Daniele Paolo Scarpazza, David Porter, demonsome, Dimo Velev, Ekang Monyet, Ethan Chan, Francois Audeon, Gilad Reti, heartofrain, Horst Schirmeier, Hsin-Hsiang Peng, Ignacio Martin, I-Hsin Cheng, I\u00fbnn Ki\u00e0n-\u00eeng, Jian-Xing Wu, Johan Calle, keytouch, Kohei Otsuka, Kuan-Wei Chiu, manbing, Marconi Jiang, mengxinayan, Meng-Zong Tsai, Peter Lin, Roman Lakeev, Sam Erickson, Shao-Tse Hung, Shih-Sheng Yang, Stacy Prowell, Steven Lung, Tristan Lelong, Tse-Wei Lin, Tucker Polomik, Tyler Fanelli, VxTeemo, Wei-Hsin Yeh, Wei-Lun Tsai, Xatierlike Lee, Yen-Yu Chen, Yin-Chiuan Chen, Yi-Wei Lin, Yo-Jung Lin, Yu-Hsiang Tseng, YYGO.\n\n#### 1.3 What Is A Kernel Module?\n\nInvolvement in the development of Linux kernel modules requires a foundation in the C programming language and a track record of creating conventional programs intended for process execution. This pursuit delves into a domain where an unregulated pointer, if disregarded, may potentially trigger the total elimination of an entire file system, resulting in a scenario that necessitates a complete system reboot.\n\nA Linux kernel module is precisely defined as a code segment capable of dynamic loading and unloading within the kernel as needed. These modules enhance kernel capabilities without necessitating a system reboot. A notable example is seen in the device driver module, which facilitates kernel interaction with hardware components linked to the system. In the absence of modules, the prevailing approach leans toward monolithic kernels, requiring direct integration of new functionalities into the kernel image. This approach leads to larger kernels and necessitates kernel rebuilding and subsequent system rebooting when new functionalities are desired.\n\n#### 1.4 Kernel module package\n\nLinux distributions provide the commands `modprobe` , `insmod` and `depmod` within a package.\n\nOn Ubuntu/Debian GNU/Linux:\n\n1sudo\u00a0apt-get\u00a0install\u00a0build-essential\u00a0kmod\n\nOn Arch Linux:\n\n1sudo\u00a0pacman\u00a0-S\u00a0gcc\u00a0kmod\n\n#### 1.5 What Modules are in my Kernel?\n\nTo discover what modules are already loaded within your current kernel use the command `lsmod` .\n\n1sudo\u00a0lsmod\n\nModules are stored within the file /proc/modules, so you can also see them with:\n\n1sudo\u00a0cat\u00a0/proc/modules\n\nThis can be a long list, and you might prefer to search for something particular. To search for the fat module:\n\n1sudo\u00a0lsmod\u00a0|\u00a0grep\u00a0fat\n\n#### 1.6 Is there a need to download and compile the kernel?\n\nTo effectively follow this guide, there is no obligatory requirement for performing such actions. Nonetheless, a prudent approach involves executing the examples within a test distribution on a virtual machine, thus mitigating any potential risk of disrupting the system.\n\n#### 1.7 Before We Begin\n\nBefore delving into code, certain matters require attention. Variances exist among individuals\u2019 systems, and distinct personal approaches are evident. The achievement of successful compilation and loading of the inaugural \u201chello world\u201d program may, at times, present challenges. It is reassuring to note that overcoming the initial obstacle in the first attempt paves the way for subsequent endeavors to proceed seamlessly.\n\n1.  Modversioning. A module compiled for one kernel will not load if a different kernel is booted, unless `CONFIG_MODVERSIONS` is enabled in the kernel. Module versioning will be discussed later in this guide. Until module versioning is covered, the examples in this guide may not work correctly if running a kernel with modversioning turned on. However, most stock Linux distribution kernels come with modversioning enabled. If difficulties arise when loading the modules due to versioning errors, consider compiling a kernel with modversioning turned off.\n2.  Using X Window System. It is highly recommended to extract, compile, and load all the examples discussed in this guide from a console. Working on these tasks within the X Window System is discouraged.\n    \n    Modules cannot directly print to the screen like `printf()` can, but they can log information and warnings that are eventually displayed on the screen, specifically within a console. If a module is loaded from an `xterm` , the information and warnings will be logged, but solely within the systemd journal. These logs will not be visible unless consulting the `journalctl` . Refer to [4](#hello-world)\n     for more information. For instant access to this information, it is advisable to perform all tasks from the console.\n    \n3.  SecureBoot. Numerous modern computers arrive pre-configured with UEFI SecureBoot enabled\u2014an essential security standard ensuring booting exclusively through trusted software endorsed by the original equipment manufacturer. Certain Linux distributions even ship with the default Linux kernel configured to support SecureBoot. In these cases, the kernel module necessitates a signed security key.\n    \n    Failing this, an attempt to insert your first \u201chello world\u201d module would result in the message: \u201cERROR: could not insert module\u201d. If this message Lockdown: insmod: unsigned module loading is restricted; see man kernel lockdown.7 appears in the `dmesg` output, the simplest approach involves disabling UEFI SecureBoot from the boot menu of your PC or laptop, allowing the successful insertion of \u201chello world\u201d module. Naturally, an alternative involves undergoing intricate procedures such as generating keys, system key installation, and module signing to achieve functionality. However, this intricate process is less appropriate for beginners. If interested, more detailed steps for [SecureBoot](https://wiki.debian.org/SecureBoot)\n     can be explored and followed.\n    \n\n### 2 Headers\n\nBefore building anything, it is necessary to install the header files for the kernel.\n\nOn Ubuntu/Debian GNU/Linux:\n\n1sudo\u00a0apt-get\u00a0update \n2apt-cache\u00a0search\u00a0linux-headers-\\`uname\u00a0-r\\`\n\nThe following command provides information on the available kernel header files. Then for example:\n\n1sudo\u00a0apt-get\u00a0install\u00a0kmod\u00a0linux-headers-5.4.0-80-generic\n\nOn Arch Linux:\n\n1sudo\u00a0pacman\u00a0-S\u00a0linux-headers\n\nOn Fedora:\n\n1sudo\u00a0dnf\u00a0install\u00a0kernel-devel\u00a0kernel-headers\n\n### 3 Examples\n\nAll the examples from this document are available within the examples subdirectory.\n\nShould compile errors occur, it may be due to a more recent kernel version being in use, or there might be a need to install the corresponding kernel header files.\n\n### 4 Hello World\n\n#### 4.1 The Simplest Module\n\nMost individuals beginning their programming journey typically start with some variant of a hello world example. It is unclear what the outcomes are for those who deviate from this tradition, but it seems prudent to adhere to it. The learning process will begin with a series of hello world programs that illustrate various fundamental aspects of writing a kernel module.\n\nPresented next is the simplest possible module.\n\nMake a test directory:\n\n1mkdir\u00a0-p\u00a0~/develop/kernel/hello-1 \n2cd\u00a0~/develop/kernel/hello-1\n\nPaste this into your favorite editor and save it as hello-1.c:\n\n1/\\* \n2\u00a0\\*\u00a0hello-1.c\u00a0-\u00a0The\u00a0simplest\u00a0kernel\u00a0module. \n3\u00a0\\*/ \n4#include\u00a0<linux/module.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0Needed\u00a0by\u00a0all\u00a0modules\u00a0\\*/ \n5#include\u00a0<linux/printk.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0Needed\u00a0for\u00a0pr\\_info()\u00a0\\*/ \n6 \n7int\u00a0init\\_module(void) \n8{ \n9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pr\\_info(\"Hello\u00a0world\u00a01.\\\\n\"); \n10 \n11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/\\*\u00a0A\u00a0non\u00a00\u00a0return\u00a0means\u00a0init\\_module\u00a0failed;\u00a0module\u00a0can't\u00a0be\u00a0loaded.\u00a0\\*/ \n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0return\u00a00; \n13} \n14 \n15void\u00a0cleanup\\_module(void) \n16{ \n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pr\\_info(\"Goodbye\u00a0world\u00a01.\\\\n\"); \n18} \n19 \n20MODULE\\_LICENSE(\"GPL\");\n\nNow you will need a Makefile. If you copy and paste this, change the indentation to use tabs, not spaces.\n\n1obj-m\u00a0+=\u00a0hello-1.o \n2 \n3PWD\u00a0:=\u00a0$(CURDIR) \n4 \n5all: \n6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0make\u00a0-C\u00a0/lib/modules/$(shell\u00a0uname\u00a0-r)/build\u00a0M=$(PWD)\u00a0modules \n7 \n8clean: \n9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0make\u00a0-C\u00a0/lib/modules/$(shell\u00a0uname\u00a0-r)/build\u00a0M=$(PWD)\u00a0clean\n\nIn Makefile, $(CURDIR) can set to the absolute pathname of the current working directory(after all \\-C options are processed, if any). See more about CURDIR in [GNU make manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)\n.\n\nAnd finally, just run make directly.\n\n1make\n\nIf there is no PWD\u00a0:=\u00a0$(CURDIR) statement in Makefile, then it may not compile correctly with sudo\u00a0make. Because some environment variables are specified by the security policy, they can\u2019t be inherited. The default security policy is sudoers. In the sudoers security policy, env\\_reset is enabled by default, which restricts environment variables. Specifically, path variables are not retained from the user environment, they are set to default values (For more information see: [sudoers manual](https://www.sudo.ws/docs/man/sudoers.man/)\n). You can see the environment variable settings by:\n\n$\u00a0sudo\u00a0-s\n#\u00a0sudo\u00a0-V\n\nHere is a simple Makefile as an example to demonstrate the problem mentioned above.\n\n1all: \n2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0echo\u00a0$(PWD)\n\nThen, we can use \\-p flag to print out the environment variable values from the Makefile.\n\n$\u00a0make\u00a0-p\u00a0|\u00a0grep\u00a0PWD\nPWD\u00a0=\u00a0/home/ubuntu/temp\nOLDPWD\u00a0=\u00a0/home/ubuntu\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0echo\u00a0$(PWD)\n\nThe PWD variable won\u2019t be inherited with sudo.\n\n$\u00a0sudo\u00a0make\u00a0-p\u00a0|\u00a0grep\u00a0PWD\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0echo\u00a0$(PWD)\n\nHowever, there are three ways to solve this problem.\n\n1.  You can use the \\-E flag to temporarily preserve them.\n    \n    1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$\u00a0sudo\u00a0-E\u00a0make\u00a0-p\u00a0|\u00a0grep\u00a0PWD \n    2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PWD\u00a0=\u00a0/home/ubuntu/temp \n    3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OLDPWD\u00a0=\u00a0/home/ubuntu \n    4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0echo\u00a0$(PWD)\n    \n2.  You can set the env\\_reset disabled by editing the /etc/sudoers with root and visudo.\n    \n    1\u00a0\u00a0##\u00a0sudoers\u00a0file. \n    2\u00a0\u00a0## \n    3\u00a0\u00a0... \n    4\u00a0\u00a0Defaults\u00a0env\\_reset \n    5\u00a0\u00a0##\u00a0Change\u00a0env\\_reset\u00a0to\u00a0!env\\_reset\u00a0in\u00a0previous\u00a0line\u00a0to\u00a0keep\u00a0all\u00a0environment\u00a0variables\n    \n    Then execute env and sudo\u00a0env individually.\n    \n    1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0#\u00a0disable\u00a0the\u00a0env\\_reset \n    2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0echo\u00a0\"user:\"\u00a0>\u00a0non-env\\_reset.log;\u00a0env\u00a0>>\u00a0non-env\\_reset.log \n    3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0echo\u00a0\"root:\"\u00a0>>\u00a0non-env\\_reset.log;\u00a0sudo\u00a0env\u00a0>>\u00a0non-env\\_reset.log \n    4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0#\u00a0enable\u00a0the\u00a0env\\_reset \n    5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0echo\u00a0\"user:\"\u00a0>\u00a0env\\_reset.log;\u00a0env\u00a0>>\u00a0env\\_reset.log \n    6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0echo\u00a0\"root:\"\u00a0>>\u00a0env\\_reset.log;\u00a0sudo\u00a0env\u00a0>>\u00a0env\\_reset.log\n    \n    You can view and compare these logs to find differences between env\\_reset and !env\\_reset.\n    \n3.  You can preserve environment variables by appending them to env\\_keep in /etc/sudoers.\n    \n    1\u00a0\u00a0Defaults\u00a0env\\_keep\u00a0+=\u00a0\"PWD\"\n    \n    After applying the above change, you can check the environment variable settings by:\n    \n         \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$\u00a0sudo\u00a0-s\n         \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0#\u00a0sudo\u00a0-V\n         \u00a0\u00a0\n    \n\nIf all goes smoothly you should then find that you have a compiled hello-1.ko module. You can find info on it with the command:\n\n1modinfo\u00a0hello-1.ko\n\nAt this point the command:\n\n1sudo\u00a0lsmod\u00a0|\u00a0grep\u00a0hello\n\nshould return nothing. You can try loading your shiny new module with:\n\n1sudo\u00a0insmod\u00a0hello-1.ko\n\nThe dash character will get converted to an underscore, so when you again try:\n\n1sudo\u00a0lsmod\u00a0|\u00a0grep\u00a0hello\n\nYou should now see your loaded module. It can be removed again with:\n\n1sudo\u00a0rmmod\u00a0hello\\_1\n\nNotice that the dash was replaced by an underscore. To see what just happened in the logs:\n\n1sudo\u00a0journalctl\u00a0--since\u00a0\"1\u00a0hour\u00a0ago\"\u00a0|\u00a0grep\u00a0kernel\n\nYou now know the basics of creating, compiling, installing and removing modules. Now for more of a description of how this module works.\n\nKernel modules must have at least two functions: a \"start\" (initialization) function called `init_module()` which is called when the module is `insmod` ed into the kernel, and an \"end\" (cleanup) function called `cleanup_module()` which is called just before it is removed from the kernel. Actually, things have changed starting with kernel 2.3.13. You can now use whatever name you like for the start and end functions of a module, and you will learn how to do this in Section [4.2](#hello-and-goodbye)\n. In fact, the new method is the preferred method. However, many people still use `init_module()` and `cleanup_module()` for their start and end functions.\n\nTypically, `init_module()` either registers a handler for something with the kernel, or it replaces one of the kernel functions with its own code (usually code to do something and then call the original function). The `cleanup_module()` function is supposed to undo whatever `init_module()` did, so the module can be unloaded safely.\n\nLastly, every kernel module needs to include <linux/module.h>. We needed to include <linux/printk.h> only for the macro expansion for the `pr_alert()` log level, which you\u2019ll learn about in Section [2](#x1-121662)\n.\n\n1.  A point about coding style. Another thing which may not be immediately obvious to anyone getting started with kernel programming is that indentation within your code should be using tabs and not spaces. It is one of the coding conventions of the kernel. You may not like it, but you\u2019ll need to get used to it if you ever submit a patch upstream.\n2.  Introducing print macros. In the beginning there was `printk` , usually followed by a priority such as `KERN_INFO` or `KERN_DEBUG` . More recently this can also be expressed in abbreviated form using a set of print macros, such as `pr_info` and `pr_debug` . This just saves some mindless keyboard bashing and looks a bit neater. They can be found within [include/linux/printk.h](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/include/linux/printk.h)\n    . Take time to read through the available priority macros.\n3.  About Compiling. Kernel modules need to be compiled a bit differently from regular userspace apps. Former kernel versions required us to care much about these settings, which are usually stored in Makefiles. Although hierarchically organized, many redundant settings accumulated in sublevel Makefiles and made them large and rather difficult to maintain. Fortunately, there is a new way of doing these things, called kbuild, and the build process for external loadable modules is now fully integrated into the standard kernel build mechanism. To learn more on how to compile modules which are not part of the official kernel (such as all the examples you will find in this guide), see file [Documentation/kbuild/modules.rst](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/Documentation/kbuild/modules.rst)\n    .\n    \n    Additional details about Makefiles for kernel modules are available in [Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.rst](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.rst)\n    . Be sure to read this and the related files before starting to hack Makefiles. It will probably save you lots of work.\n    \n    > Here is another exercise for the reader. See that comment above the return statement in `init_module()` ? Change the return value to something negative, recompile and load the module again. What happens?\n    \n\n#### 4.2 Hello and Goodbye\n\nIn early kernel versions you had to use the `init_module` and `cleanup_module` functions, as in the first hello world example, but these days you can name those anything you want by using the `module_init` and `module_exit` macros. These macros are defined in [include/linux/module.h](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/include/linux/module.h)\n. The only requirement is that your init and cleanup functions must be defined before calling the those macros, otherwise you\u2019ll get compilation errors. Here is an example of this technique:\n\n1/\\* \n2\u00a0\\*\u00a0hello-2.c\u00a0-\u00a0Demonstrating\u00a0the\u00a0module\\_init()\u00a0and\u00a0module\\_exit()\u00a0macros. \n3\u00a0\\*\u00a0This\u00a0is\u00a0preferred\u00a0over\u00a0using\u00a0init\\_module()\u00a0and\u00a0cleanup\\_module(). \n4\u00a0\\*/ \n5#include\u00a0<linux/init.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0Needed\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0macros\u00a0\\*/ \n6#include\u00a0<linux/module.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0Needed\u00a0by\u00a0all\u00a0modules\u00a0\\*/ \n7#include\u00a0<linux/printk.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0Needed\u00a0for\u00a0pr\\_info()\u00a0\\*/ \n8 \n9static\u00a0int\u00a0\\_\\_init\u00a0hello\\_2\\_init(void) \n10{ \n11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pr\\_info(\"Hello,\u00a0world\u00a02\\\\n\"); \n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0return\u00a00; \n13} \n14 \n15static\u00a0void\u00a0\\_\\_exit\u00a0hello\\_2\\_exit(void) \n16{ \n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pr\\_info(\"Goodbye,\u00a0world\u00a02\\\\n\"); \n18} \n19 \n20module\\_init(hello\\_2\\_init); \n21module\\_exit(hello\\_2\\_exit); \n22 \n23MODULE\\_LICENSE(\"GPL\");\n\nSo now we have two real kernel modules under our belt. Adding another module is as simple as this:\n\n1obj-m\u00a0+=\u00a0hello-1.o \n2obj-m\u00a0+=\u00a0hello-2.o \n3 \n4PWD\u00a0:=\u00a0$(CURDIR) \n5 \n6all: \n7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0make\u00a0-C\u00a0/lib/modules/$(shell\u00a0uname\u00a0-r)/build\u00a0M=$(PWD)\u00a0modules \n8 \n9clean: \n10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0make\u00a0-C\u00a0/lib/modules/$(shell\u00a0uname\u00a0-r)/build\u00a0M=$(PWD)\u00a0clean\n\nNow have a look at [drivers/char/Makefile](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/drivers/char/Makefile)\n for a real world example. As you can see, some things got hardwired into the kernel (obj-y) but where have all those obj-m gone? Those familiar with shell scripts will easily be able to spot them. For those who are not, the obj-$(CONFIG\\_FOO) entries you see everywhere expand into obj-y or obj-m, depending on whether the CONFIG\\_FOO variable has been set to y or m. While we are at it, those were exactly the kind of variables that you have set in the .config file in the top-level directory of Linux kernel source tree, the last time when you said `make\u00a0menuconfig` or something like that.\n\n#### 4.3 The \\_\\_init and \\_\\_exit Macros\n\nThe `__init` macro causes the init function to be discarded and its memory freed once the init function finishes for built-in drivers, but not loadable modules. If you think about when the init function is invoked, this makes perfect sense.\n\nThere is also an `__initdata` which works similarly to `__init` but for init variables rather than functions.\n\nThe `__exit` macro causes the omission of the function when the module is built into the kernel, and like `__init` , has no effect for loadable modules. Again, if you consider when the cleanup function runs, this makes complete sense; built-in drivers do not need a cleanup function, while loadable modules do.\n\nThese macros are defined in [include/linux/init.h](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/include/linux/init.h)\n and serve to free up kernel memory. When you boot your kernel and see something like Freeing unused kernel memory: 236k freed, this is precisely what the kernel is freeing.\n\n1/\\* \n2\u00a0\\*\u00a0hello-3.c\u00a0-\u00a0Illustrating\u00a0the\u00a0\\_\\_init,\u00a0\\_\\_initdata\u00a0and\u00a0\\_\\_exit\u00a0macros. \n3\u00a0\\*/ \n4#include\u00a0<linux/init.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0Needed\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0macros\u00a0\\*/ \n5#include\u00a0<linux/module.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0Needed\u00a0by\u00a0all\u00a0modules\u00a0\\*/ \n6#include\u00a0<linux/printk.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0Needed\u00a0for\u00a0pr\\_info()\u00a0\\*/ \n7 \n8static\u00a0int\u00a0hello3\\_data\u00a0\\_\\_initdata\u00a0=\u00a03; \n9 \n10static\u00a0int\u00a0\\_\\_init\u00a0hello\\_3\\_init(void) \n11{ \n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pr\\_info(\"Hello,\u00a0world\u00a0%d\\\\n\",\u00a0hello3\\_data); \n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0return\u00a00; \n14} \n15 \n16static\u00a0void\u00a0\\_\\_exit\u00a0hello\\_3\\_exit(void) \n17{ \n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pr\\_info(\"Goodbye,\u00a0world\u00a03\\\\n\"); \n19} \n20 \n21module\\_init(hello\\_3\\_init); \n22module\\_exit(hello\\_3\\_exit); \n23 \n24MODULE\\_LICENSE(\"GPL\");\n\n#### 4.4 Licensing and Module Documentation\n\nHonestly, who loads or even cares about proprietary modules? If you do then you might have seen something like this:\n\n$\u00a0sudo\u00a0insmod\u00a0xxxxxx.ko\nloading\u00a0out-of-tree\u00a0module\u00a0taints\u00a0kernel.\nmodule\u00a0license\u00a0'unspecified'\u00a0taints\u00a0kernel.\n\nYou can use a few macros to indicate the license for your module. Some examples are \"GPL\", \"GPL v2\", \"GPL and additional rights\", \"Dual BSD/GPL\", \"Dual MIT/GPL\", \"Dual MPL/GPL\" and \"Proprietary\". They are defined within [include/linux/module.h](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/include/linux/module.h)\n.\n\nTo reference what license you\u2019re using a macro is available called `MODULE_LICENSE` . This and a few other macros describing the module are illustrated in the below example.\n\n1/\\* \n2\u00a0\\*\u00a0hello-4.c\u00a0-\u00a0Demonstrates\u00a0module\u00a0documentation. \n3\u00a0\\*/ \n4#include\u00a0<linux/init.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0Needed\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0macros\u00a0\\*/ \n5#include\u00a0<linux/module.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0Needed\u00a0by\u00a0all\u00a0modules\u00a0\\*/ \n6#include\u00a0<linux/printk.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0Needed\u00a0for\u00a0pr\\_info()\u00a0\\*/ \n7 \n8MODULE\\_LICENSE(\"GPL\"); \n9MODULE\\_AUTHOR(\"LKMPG\"); \n10MODULE\\_DESCRIPTION(\"A\u00a0sample\u00a0driver\"); \n11 \n12static\u00a0int\u00a0\\_\\_init\u00a0init\\_hello\\_4(void) \n13{ \n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pr\\_info(\"Hello,\u00a0world\u00a04\\\\n\"); \n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0return\u00a00; \n16} \n17 \n18static\u00a0void\u00a0\\_\\_exit\u00a0cleanup\\_hello\\_4(void) \n19{ \n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pr\\_info(\"Goodbye,\u00a0world\u00a04\\\\n\"); \n21} \n22 \n23module\\_init(init\\_hello\\_4); \n24module\\_exit(cleanup\\_hello\\_4);\n\n#### 4.5 Passing Command Line Arguments to a Module\n\nModules can take command line arguments, but not with the argc/argv you might be used to.\n\nTo allow arguments to be passed to your module, declare the variables that will take the values of the command line arguments as global and then use the `module_param()` macro, (defined in [include/linux/moduleparam.h](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/include/linux/moduleparam.h)\n) to set the mechanism up. At runtime, `insmod` will fill the variables with any command line arguments that are given, like `insmod\u00a0mymodule.ko\u00a0myvariable=5` . The variable declarations and macros should be placed at the beginning of the module for clarity. The example code should clear up my admittedly lousy explanation.\n\nThe `module_param()` macro takes 3 arguments: the name of the variable, its type and permissions for the corresponding file in sysfs. Integer types can be signed as usual or unsigned. If you\u2019d like to use arrays of integers or strings see `module_param_array()` and `module_param_string()` .\n\n1int\u00a0myint\u00a0=\u00a03; \n2module\\_param(myint,\u00a0int,\u00a00);\n\nArrays are supported too, but things are a bit different now than they were in the olden days. To keep track of the number of parameters you need to pass a pointer to a count variable as third parameter. At your option, you could also ignore the count and pass `NULL` instead. We show both possibilities here:\n\n1int\u00a0myintarray\\[2\\]; \n2module\\_param\\_array(myintarray,\u00a0int,\u00a0NULL,\u00a00);\u00a0/\\*\u00a0not\u00a0interested\u00a0in\u00a0count\u00a0\\*/ \n3 \n4short\u00a0myshortarray\\[4\\]; \n5int\u00a0count; \n6module\\_param\\_array(myshortarray,\u00a0short,\u00a0&count,\u00a00);\u00a0/\\*\u00a0put\u00a0count\u00a0into\u00a0\"count\"\u00a0variable\u00a0\\*/\n\nA good use for this is to have the module variable\u2019s default values set, like a port or IO address. If the variables contain the default values, then perform autodetection (explained elsewhere). Otherwise, keep the current value. This will be made clear later on.\n\nLastly, there is a macro function, `MODULE_PARM_DESC()` , that is used to document arguments that the module can take. It takes two parameters: a variable name and a free form string describing that variable.\n\n1/\\* \n2\u00a0\\*\u00a0hello-5.c\u00a0-\u00a0Demonstrates\u00a0command\u00a0line\u00a0argument\u00a0passing\u00a0to\u00a0a\u00a0module. \n3\u00a0\\*/ \n4#include\u00a0<linux/init.h> \n5#include\u00a0<linux/kernel.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0for\u00a0ARRAY\\_SIZE()\u00a0\\*/ \n6#include\u00a0<linux/module.h> \n7#include\u00a0<linux/moduleparam.h> \n8#include\u00a0<linux/printk.h> \n9#include\u00a0<linux/stat.h> \n10 \n11MODULE\\_LICENSE(\"GPL\");

The first five lines are nothing special, but for the last example we will need two lines. First we invent an object name for our combined module, second we tell `make` what object files are part of that module.\n\n#### 4.7 Building modules for a precompiled kernel\n\nObviously, we strongly suggest you to recompile your kernel, so that you can enable a number of useful debugging features, such as forced module unloading ( `MODULE_FORCE_UNLOAD` ): when this option is enabled, you can force the kernel to unload a module even when it believes it is unsafe, via a `sudo\u00a0rmmod\u00a0-f\u00a0module` command. This option can save you a lot of time and a number of reboots during the development of a module. If you do not want to recompile your kernel then you should consider running the examples within a test distribution on a virtual machine. If you mess anything up then you can easily reboot or restore the virtual machine (VM).\n\nThere are a number of cases in which you may want to load your module into a precompiled running kernel, such as the ones shipped with common Linux distributions, or a kernel you have compiled in the past. In certain circumstances you could require to compile and insert a module into a running kernel which you are not allowed to recompile, or on a machine that you prefer not to reboot. If you can\u2019t think of a case that will force you to use modules for a precompiled kernel you might want to skip this and treat the rest of this chapter as a big footnote.\n\nNow, if you just install a kernel source tree, use it to compile your kernel module and you try to insert your module into the kernel, in most cases you would obtain an error as follows:\n\ninsmod:\u00a0ERROR:\u00a0could\u00a0not\u00a0insert\u00a0module\u00a0poet.ko:\u00a0Invalid\u00a0module\u00a0format\n\nLess cryptic information is logged to the systemd journal:\n\nkernel:\u00a0poet:\u00a0disagrees\u00a0about\u00a0version\u00a0of\u00a0symbol\u00a0module\\_layout\n\nIn other words, your kernel refuses to accept your module because version strings (more precisely, version magic, see [include/linux/vermagic.h](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/include/linux/vermagic.h)\n) do not match. Incidentally, version magic strings are stored in the module object in the form of a static string, starting with `vermagic:` . Version data are inserted in your module when it is linked against the kernel/module.o file. To inspect version magics and other strings stored in a given module, issue the command `modinfo\u00a0module.ko` :\n\n$\u00a0modinfo\u00a0hello-4.ko\ndescription:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A\u00a0sample\u00a0driver\nauthor:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LKMPG\nlicense:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0GPL\nsrcversion:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0B2AA7FBFCC2C39AED665382\ndepends:\nretpoline:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Y\nname:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0hello\\_4\nvermagic:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05.4.0-70-generic\u00a0SMP\u00a0mod\\_unload\u00a0modversions\n\nTo overcome this problem we could resort to the \\--force-vermagic option, but this solution is potentially unsafe, and unquestionably unacceptable in production modules. Consequently, we want to compile our module in an environment which was identical to the one in which our precompiled kernel was built. How to do this, is the subject of the remainder of this chapter.\n\nFirst of all, make sure that a kernel source tree is available, having exactly the same version as your current kernel. Then, find the configuration file which was used to compile your precompiled kernel. Usually, this is available in your current boot directory, under a name like config-5.14.x. You may just want to copy it to your kernel source tree: ``cp\u00a0/boot/config-`uname\u00a0-r`\u00a0.config`` .\n\nLet\u2019s focus again on the previous error message: a closer look at the version magic strings suggests that, even with two configuration files which are exactly the same, a slight difference in the version magic could be possible, and it is sufficient to prevent insertion of the module into the kernel. That slight difference, namely the custom string which appears in the module\u2019s version magic and not in the kernel\u2019s one, is due to a modification with respect to the original, in the makefile that some distributions include. Then, examine your Makefile, and make sure that the specified version information matches exactly the one used for your current kernel. For example, your makefile could start as follows:\n\nVERSION\u00a0=\u00a05\nPATCHLEVEL\u00a0=\u00a014\nSUBLEVEL\u00a0=\u00a00\nEXTRAVERSION\u00a0=\u00a0-rc2\n\nIn this case, you need to restore the value of symbol EXTRAVERSION to \\-rc2. We suggest keeping a backup copy of the makefile used to compile your kernel available in /lib/modules/5.14.0-rc2/build. A simple command as following should suffice.\n\n1cp\u00a0/lib/modules/\\`uname\u00a0-r\\`/build/Makefile\u00a0linux-\\`uname\u00a0-r\\`\n\nHere `` linux-`uname\u00a0-r` `` is the Linux kernel source you are attempting to build.\n\nNow, please run `make` to update configuration and version headers and objects:\n\n$\u00a0make\n\u00a0\u00a0SYNC\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0include/config/auto.conf.cmd\n\u00a0\u00a0HOSTCC\u00a0\u00a0scripts/basic/fixdep\n\u00a0\u00a0HOSTCC\u00a0\u00a0scripts/kconfig/conf.o\n\u00a0\u00a0HOSTCC\u00a0\u00a0scripts/kconfig/confdata.o\n\u00a0\u00a0HOSTCC\u00a0\u00a0scripts/kconfig/expr.o\n\u00a0\u00a0LEX\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0scripts/kconfig/lexer.lex.c\n\u00a0\u00a0YACC\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0scripts/kconfig/parser.tab.\\[ch\\]\n\u00a0\u00a0HOSTCC\u00a0\u00a0scripts/kconfig/preprocess.o\n\u00a0\u00a0HOSTCC\u00a0\u00a0scripts/kconfig/symbol.o\n\u00a0\u00a0HOSTCC\u00a0\u00a0scripts/kconfig/util.o\n\u00a0\u00a0HOSTCC\u00a0\u00a0scripts/kconfig/lexer.lex.o\n\u00a0\u00a0HOSTCC\u00a0\u00a0scripts/kconfig/parser.tab.o\n\u00a0\u00a0HOSTLD\u00a0\u00a0scripts/kconfig/conf\n\nIf you do not desire to actually compile the kernel, you can interrupt the build process (CTRL-C) just after the SPLIT line, because at that time, the files you need are ready. Now you can turn back to the directory of your module and compile it: It will be built exactly according to your current kernel settings, and it will load into it without any errors.\n\n### 5 Preliminaries\n\n#### 5.1 How modules begin and end\n\nA typical program starts with a `main()` function, executes a series of instructions, and terminates after completing these instructions. Kernel modules, however, follow a different pattern. A module always begins with either the `init_module` function or a function designated by the `module_init` call. This function acts as the module\u2019s entry point, informing the kernel of the module\u2019s functionalities and preparing the kernel to utilize the module\u2019s functions when necessary. After performing these tasks, the entry function returns, and the module remains inactive until the kernel requires its code.\n\nAll modules conclude by invoking either `cleanup_module` or a function specified through the `module_exit` call. This serves as the module\u2019s exit function, reversing the actions of the entry function by unregistering the previously registered functionalities.\n\nIt is mandatory for every module to have both an entry and an exit function. While there are multiple methods to define these functions, the terms \u201centry function\u201d and \u201cexit function\u201d are generally used. However, they may occasionally be referred to as `init_module` and `cleanup_module` , which are understood to mean the same.\n\n#### 5.2 Functions available to modules\n\nProgrammers use functions they do not define all the time. A prime example of this is `printf()` . You use these library functions which are provided by the standard C library, libc. The definitions for these functions do not actually enter your program until the linking stage, which ensures that the code (for `printf()` for example) is available, and fixes the call instruction to point to that code.\n\nKernel modules are different here, too. In the hello world example, you might have noticed that we used a function, `pr_info()` but did not include a standard I/O library. That is because modules are object files whose symbols get resolved upon running `insmod` or `modprobe` . The definition for the symbols comes from the kernel itself; the only external functions you can use are the ones provided by the kernel. If you\u2019re curious about what symbols have been exported by your kernel, take a look at /proc/kallsyms.\n\nOne point to keep in mind is the difference between library functions and system calls. Library functions are higher level, run completely in user space and provide a more convenient interface for the programmer to the functions that do the real work \u2014 system calls. System calls run in kernel mode on the user\u2019s behalf and are provided by the kernel itself. The library function `printf()` may look like a very general printing function, but all it really does is format the data into strings and write the string data using the low-level system call `write()` , which then sends the data to standard output.\n\nWould you like to see what system calls are made by `printf()` ? It is easy! Compile the following program:\n\n1#include\u00a0<stdio.h> \n2 \n3int\u00a0main(void) \n4{ \n5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0printf(\"hello\"); \n6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0return\u00a00; \n7}\n\nwith `gcc\u00a0-Wall\u00a0-o\u00a0hello\u00a0hello.c` . Run the executable with `strace\u00a0./hello` . Are you impressed? Every line you see corresponds to a system call. [strace](https://strace.io/)\n is a handy program that gives you details about what system calls a program is making, including which call is made, what its arguments are and what it returns. It is an invaluable tool for figuring out things like what files a program is trying to access. Towards the end, you will see a line which looks like `write(1,\u00a0\"hello\",\u00a05hello)` . There it is. The face behind the `printf()` mask. You may not be familiar with write, since most people use library functions for file I/O (like `fopen` , `fputs` , `fclose` ). If that is the case, try looking at man 2 write. The 2nd man section is devoted to system calls (like `kill()` and `read()` ). The 3rd man section is devoted to library calls, which you would probably be more familiar with (like `cosh()` and `random()` ).\n\nYou can even write modules to replace the kernel\u2019s system calls, which we will do shortly. Crackers often make use of this sort of thing for backdoors or trojans, but you can write your own modules to do more benign things, like have the kernel write Tee hee, that tickles! every time someone tries to delete a file on your system.\n\n#### 5.3 User Space vs Kernel Space\n\nThe kernel primarily manages access to resources, be it a video card, hard drive, or memory. Programs frequently vie for the same resources. For instance, as a document is saved, updatedb might commence updating the locate database. Sessions in editors like vim and processes like updatedb can simultaneously utilize the hard drive. The kernel\u2019s role is to maintain order, ensuring that users do not access resources indiscriminately.\n\nTo manage this, CPUs operate in different modes, each offering varying levels of system control. The Intel 80386 architecture, for example, featured four such modes, known as rings. Unix, however, utilizes only two of these rings: the highest ring (ring 0, also known as \u201csupervisor mode\u201d, where all actions are permissible) and the lowest ring, referred to as \u201cuser mode\u201d.\n\nRecall the discussion about library functions vs system calls. Typically, you use a library function in user mode. The library function calls one or more system calls, and these system calls execute on the library function\u2019s behalf, but do so in supervisor mode since they are part of the kernel itself. Once the system call completes its task, it returns and execution gets transferred back to user mode.\n\n#### 5.4 Name Space\n\nWhen you write a small C program, you use variables which are convenient and make sense to the reader. If, on the other hand, you are writing routines which will be part of a bigger problem, any global variables you have are part of a community of other peoples\u2019 global variables; some of the variable names can clash. When a program has lots of global variables which aren\u2019t meaningful enough to be distinguished, you get namespace pollution. In large projects, effort must be made to remember reserved names, and to find ways to develop a scheme for naming unique variable names and symbols.\n\nWhen writing kernel code, even the smallest module will be linked against the entire kernel, so this is definitely an issue. The best way to deal with this is to declare all your variables as static and to use a well-defined prefix for your symbols. By convention, all kernel prefixes are lowercase. If you do not want to declare everything as static, another option is to declare a symbol table and register it with the kernel. We will get to this later.\n\nThe file /proc/kallsyms holds all the symbols that the kernel knows about and which are therefore accessible to your modules since they share the kernel\u2019s codespace.\n\n#### 5.5 Code space\n\nMemory management is a very complicated subject and the majority of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s [Understanding The Linux Kernel](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/understanding-the-linux/0596005652/)\n exclusively covers memory management! We are not setting out to be experts on memory managements, but we do need to know a couple of facts to even begin worrying about writing real modules.\n\nIf you have not thought about what a segfault really means, you may be surprised to hear that pointers do not actually point to memory locations. Not real ones, anyway. When a process is created, the kernel sets aside a portion of real physical memory and hands it to the process to use for its executing code, variables, stack, heap and other things which a computer scientist would know about. This memory begins with 0x00000000 and extends up to whatever it needs to be. Since the memory space for any two processes do not overlap, every process that can access a memory address, say 0xbffff978, would be accessing a different location in real physical memory! The processes would be accessing an index named 0xbffff978 which points to some kind of offset into the region of memory set aside for that particular process. For the most part, a process like our Hello, World program can\u2019t access the space of another process, although there are ways which we will talk about later.\n\nThe kernel has its own space of memory as well. Since a module is code which can be dynamically inserted and removed in the kernel (as opposed to a semi-autonomous object), it shares the kernel\u2019s codespace rather than having its own. Therefore, if your module segfaults, the kernel segfaults. And if you start writing over data because of an off-by-one error, then you\u2019re trampling on kernel data (or code). This is even worse than it sounds, so try your best to be careful.\n\nIt should be noted that the aforementioned discussion applies to any operating system utilizing a monolithic kernel. This concept differs slightly from \u201cbuilding all your modules into the kernel\u201d, although the underlying principle is similar. In contrast, there are microkernels, where modules are allocated their own code space. Two notable examples of microkernels include the [GNU Hurd](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/)\n and the [Zircon kernel](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/kernel)\n of Google\u2019s Fuchsia.\n\n#### 5.6 Device Drivers\n\nOne class of module is the device driver, which provides functionality for hardware like a serial port. On Unix, each piece of hardware is represented by a file located in /dev named a device file which provides the means to communicate with the hardware. The device driver provides the communication on behalf of a user program. So the es1370.ko sound card device driver might connect the /dev/sound device file to the Ensoniq IS1370 sound card. A userspace program like mp3blaster can use /dev/sound without ever knowing what kind of sound card is installed.\n\nLet\u2019s look at some device files. Here are device files which represent the first three partitions on the primary master IDE hard drive:\n\n$\u00a0ls\u00a0-l\u00a0/dev/hda\\[1-3\\]\nbrw-rw----\u00a0\u00a01\u00a0root\u00a0\u00a0disk\u00a0\u00a03,\u00a01\u00a0Jul\u00a0\u00a05\u00a0\u00a02000\u00a0/dev/hda1\nbrw-rw----\u00a0\u00a01\u00a0root\u00a0\u00a0disk\u00a0\u00a03,\u00a02\u00a0Jul\u00a0\u00a05\u00a0\u00a02000\u00a0/dev/hda2\nbrw-rw----\u00a0\u00a01\u00a0root\u00a0\u00a0disk\u00a0\u00a03,\u00a03\u00a0Jul\u00a0\u00a05\u00a0\u00a02000\u00a0/dev/hda3\n\nNotice the column of numbers separated by a comma. The first number is called the device\u2019s major number. The second number is the minor number. The major number tells you which driver is used to access the hardware. Each driver is assigned a unique major number; all device files with the same major number are controlled by the same driver. All the above major numbers are 3, because they\u2019re all controlled by the same driver.\n\nThe minor number is used by the driver to distinguish between the various hardware it controls. Returning to the example above, although all three devices are handled by the same driver they have unique minor numbers because the driver sees them as being different pieces of hardware.\n\nDevices are divided into two types: character devices and block devices. The difference is that block devices have a buffer for requests, so they can choose the best order in which to respond to the requests. This is important in the case of storage devices, where it is faster to read or write sectors which are close to each other, rather than those which are further apart. Another difference is that block devices can only accept input and return output in blocks (whose size can vary according to the device), whereas character devices are allowed to use as many or as few bytes as they like. Most devices in the world are character, because they don\u2019t need this type of buffering, and they don\u2019t operate with a fixed block size. You can tell whether a device file is for a block device or a character device by looking at the first character in the output of `ls\u00a0-l` . If it is \u2018b\u2019 then it is a block device, and if it is \u2018c\u2019 then it is a character device. The devices you see above are block devices. Here are some character devices (the serial ports):\n\ncrw-rw----\u00a0\u00a01\u00a0root\u00a0\u00a0dial\u00a04,\u00a064\u00a0Feb\u00a018\u00a023:34\u00a0/dev/ttyS0\ncrw-r-----\u00a0\u00a01\u00a0root\u00a0\u00a0dial\u00a04,\u00a065\u00a0Nov\u00a017\u00a010:26\u00a0/dev/ttyS1\ncrw-rw----\u00a0\u00a01\u00a0root\u00a0\u00a0dial\u00a04,\u00a066\u00a0Jul\u00a0\u00a05\u00a0\u00a02000\u00a0/dev/ttyS2\ncrw-rw----\u00a0\u00a01\u00a0root\u00a0\u00a0dial\u00a04,\u00a067\u00a0Jul\u00a0\u00a05\u00a0\u00a02000\u00a0/dev/ttyS3\n\nIf you want to see which major numbers have been assigned, you can look at [Documentation/admin-guide/devices.txt](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/Documentation/admin-guide/devices.txt)\n.\n\nWhen the system was installed, all of those device files were created by the `mknod` command. To create a new char device named coffee with major/minor number 12 and 2, simply do `mknod\u00a0/dev/coffee\u00a0c\u00a012\u00a02` . You do not have to put your device files into /dev, but it is done by convention. Linus put his device files in /dev, and so should you. However, when creating a device file for testing purposes, it is probably OK to place it in your working directory where you compile the kernel module. Just be sure to put it in the right place when you\u2019re done writing the device driver.\n\nA few final points, although implicit in the previous discussion, are worth stating explicitly for clarity. When a device file is accessed, the kernel utilizes the file\u2019s major number to identify the appropriate driver for handling the access. This indicates that the kernel does not necessarily rely on or need to be aware of the minor number. It is the driver that concerns itself with the minor number, using it to differentiate between various pieces of hardware.\n\nIt is important to note that when referring to \u201chardware\u201d, the term is used in a slightly more abstract sense than just a physical PCI card that can be held in hand. Consider the following two device files:\n\n$\u00a0ls\u00a0-l\u00a0/dev/sda\u00a0/dev/sdb\nbrw-rw----\u00a01\u00a0root\u00a0disk\u00a08,\u00a0\u00a00\u00a0Jan\u00a0\u00a03\u00a009:02\u00a0/dev/sda\nbrw-rw----\u00a01\u00a0root\u00a0disk\u00a08,\u00a016\u00a0Jan\u00a0\u00a03\u00a009:02\u00a0/dev/sdb\n\nBy now you can look at these two device files and know instantly that they are block devices and are handled by same driver (block major 8). Sometimes two device files with the same major but different minor number can actually represent the same piece of physical hardware. So just be aware that the word \u201chardware\u201d in our discussion can mean something very abstract.\n\n### 6 Character Device drivers\n\n#### 6.1 The file\\_operations Structure\n\nThe `file_operations` structure is defined in [include/linux/fs.h](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/include/linux/fs.h)\n, and holds pointers to functions defined by the driver that perform various operations on the device. Each field of the structure corresponds to the address of some function defined by the driver to handle a requested operation.\n\nFor example, every character driver needs to define a function that reads from the device. The `file_operations` structure holds the address of the module\u2019s function that performs that operation. Here is what the definition looks like for kernel 5.4:\n\n1struct\u00a0file\\_operations\u00a0{ \n2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0struct\u00a0module\u00a0\\*owner; \n3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0loff\\_t\u00a0(\\*llseek)\u00a0(struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*,\u00a0loff\\_t,\u00a0int); \n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ssize\\_t\u00a0(\\*read)\u00a0(struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*,\u00a0char\u00a0\\_\\_user\u00a0\\*,\u00a0size\\_t,\u00a0loff\\_t\u00a0\\*); \n5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ssize\\_t\u00a0(\\*write)\u00a0(struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*,\u00a0const\u00a0char\u00a0\\_\\_user\u00a0\\*,\u00a0size\\_t,\u00a0loff\\_t\u00a0\\*); \n6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ssize\\_t\u00a0(\\*read\\_iter)\u00a0(struct\u00a0kiocb\u00a0\\*,\u00a0struct\u00a0iov\\_iter\u00a0\\*); \n7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ssize\\_t\u00a0(\\*write\\_iter)\u00a0(struct\u00a0kiocb\u00a0\\*,\u00a0struct\u00a0iov\\_iter\u00a0\\*); \n8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0int\u00a0(\\*iopoll)(struct\u00a0kiocb\u00a0\\*kiocb,\u00a0bool\u00a0spin); \n9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0int\u00a0(\\*iterate)\u00a0(struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*,\u00a0struct\u00a0dir\\_context\u00a0\\*); \n10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0int\u00a0(\\*iterate\\_shared)\u00a0(struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*,\u00a0struct\u00a0dir\\_context\u00a0\\*); \n11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\\_\\_poll\\_t\u00a0(\\*poll)\u00a0(struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*,\u00a0struct\u00a0poll\\_table\\_struct\u00a0\\*); \n12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0long\u00a0(\\*unlocked\\_ioctl)\u00a0(struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*,\u00a0unsigned\u00a0int,\u00a0unsigned\u00a0long); \n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0long\u00a0(\\*compat\\_ioctl)\u00a0(struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*,\u00a0unsigned\u00a0int,\u00a0unsigned\u00a0long); \n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0int\u00a0(\\*mmap)\u00a0(struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*,\u00a0struct\u00a0vm\\_area\\_struct\u00a0\\*); \n15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0unsigned\u00a0long\u00a0mmap\\_supported\\_flags; \n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0int\u00a0(\\*open)\u00a0(struct\u00a0inode\u00a0\\*,\u00a0struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*); \n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0int\u00a0(\\*flush)\u00a0(struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*,\u00a0fl\\_owner\\_t\u00a0id); \n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0int\u00a0(\\*release)\u00a0(struct\u00a0inode\u00a0\\*,\u00a0struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*); \n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0int\u00a0(\\*fsync)\u00a0(struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*,\u00a0loff\\_t,\u00a0loff\\_t,\u00a0int\u00a0datasync); \n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0int\u00a0(\\*fasync)\u00a0(int,\u00a0struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*,\u00a0int); \n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0int\u00a0(\\*lock)\u00a0(struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*,\u00a0int,\u00a0struct\u00a0file\\_lock\u00a0\\*); \n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ssize\\_t\u00a0(\\*sendpage)\u00a0(struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*,\u00a0struct\u00a0page\u00a0\\*,\u00a0int,\u00a0size\\_t,\u00a0loff\\_t\u00a0\\*,\u00a0int); \n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0unsigned\u00a0long\u00a0(\\*get\\_unmapped\\_area)(struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*,\u00a0unsigned\u00a0long,\u00a0unsigned\u00a0long,\u00a0unsigned\u00a0long,\u00a0unsigned\u00a0long); \n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0int\u00a0(\\*check\\_flags)(int); \n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0int\u00a0(\\*flock)\u00a0(struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*,\u00a0int,\u00a0struct\u00a0file\\_lock\u00a0\\*); \n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ssize\\_t\u00a0(\\*splice\\_write)(struct\u00a0pipe\\_inode\\_info\u00a0\\*,\u00a0struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*,\u00a0loff\\_t\u00a0\\*,\u00a0size\\_t,\u00a0unsigned\u00a0int); \n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ssize\\_t\u00a0(\\*splice\\_read)(struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*,\u00a0loff\\_t\u00a0\\*,\u00a0struct\u00a0pipe\\_inode\\_info\u00a0\\*,\u00a0size\\_t,\u00a0unsigned\u00a0int); \n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0int\u00a0(\\*setlease)(struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*,\u00a0long,\u00a0struct\u00a0file\\_lock\u00a0\\*\\*,\u00a0void\u00a0\\*\\*); \n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0long\u00a0(\\*fallocate)(struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*file,\u00a0int\u00a0mode,\u00a0loff\\_t\u00a0offset, \n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0loff\\_t\u00a0len); \n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0void\u00a0(\\*show\\_fdinfo)(struct\u00a0seq\\_file\u00a0\\*m,\u00a0struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*f); \n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ssize\\_t\u00a0(\\*copy\\_file\\_range)(struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*,\u00a0loff\\_t,\u00a0struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*, \n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0loff\\_t,\u00a0size\\_t,\u00a0unsigned\u00a0int); \n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0loff\\_t\u00a0(\\*remap\\_file\\_range)(struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*file\\_in,\u00a0loff\\_t\u00a0pos\\_in, \n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*file\\_out,\u00a0loff\\_t\u00a0pos\\_out, \n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0loff\\_t\u00a0len,\u00a0unsigned\u00a0int\u00a0remap\\_flags); \n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0int\u00a0(\\*fadvise)(struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*,\u00a0loff\\_t,\u00a0loff\\_t,\u00a0int); \n38}\u00a0\\_\\_randomize\\_layout;\n\nSome operations are not implemented by a driver. For example, a driver that handles a video card will not need to read from a directory structure. The corresponding entries in the `file_operations` structure should be set to `NULL` .\n\nThere is a gcc extension that makes assigning to this structure more convenient. You will see it in modern drivers, and may catch you by surprise. This is what the new way of assigning to the structure looks like:\n\n1struct\u00a0file\\_operations\u00a0fops\u00a0=\u00a0{ \n2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0read:\u00a0device\\_read, \n3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0write:\u00a0device\\_write, \n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0open:\u00a0device\\_open, \n5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0release:\u00a0device\\_release \n6};\n\nHowever, there is also a C99 way of assigning to elements of a structure, [designated initializers](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Designated-Inits.html)\n, and this is definitely preferred over using the GNU extension. You should use this syntax in case someone wants to port your driver. It will help with compatibility:\n\n1struct\u00a0file\\_operations\u00a0fops\u00a0=\u00a0{ \n2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.read\u00a0=\u00a0device\\_read, \n3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.write\u00a0=\u00a0device\\_write, \n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.open\u00a0=\u00a0device\\_open, \n5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.release\u00a0=\u00a0device\\_release \n6};\n\nThe meaning is clear, and you should be aware that any member of the structure which you do not explicitly assign will be initialized to `NULL` by gcc.\n\nAn instance of `struct\u00a0file_operations` containing pointers to functions that are used to implement `read` , `write` , `open` , \u2026 system calls is commonly named `fops` .\n\nSince Linux v3.14, the read, write and seek operations are guaranteed for thread-safe by using the `f_pos` specific lock, which makes the file position update to become the mutual exclusion. So, we can safely implement those operations without unnecessary locking.\n\nAdditionally, since Linux v5.6, the `proc_ops` structure was introduced to replace the use of the `file_operations` structure when registering proc handlers. See more information in the [7.1](#the-procops-structure)\n section.\n\n#### 6.2 The file structure\n\nEach device is represented in the kernel by a file structure, which is defined in [include/linux/fs.h](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/include/linux/fs.h)\n. Be aware that a file is a kernel level structure and never appears in a user space program. It is not the same thing as a `FILE` , which is defined by glibc and would never appear in a kernel space function. Also, its name is a bit misleading; it represents an abstract open \u2018file\u2019, not a file on a disk, which is represented by a structure named `inode` .\n\nAn instance of struct file is commonly named `filp` . You\u2019ll also see it referred to as a struct file object. Resist the temptation.\n\nGo ahead and look at the definition of file. Most of the entries you see, like struct dentry are not used by device drivers, and you can ignore them. This is because drivers do not fill file directly; they only use structures contained in file which are created elsewhere.\n\n#### 6.3 Registering A Device\n\nAs discussed earlier, char devices are accessed through device files, usually located in /dev. This is by convention. When writing a driver, it is OK to put the device file in your current directory. Just make sure you place it in /dev for a production driver. The major number tells you which driver handles which device file. The minor number is used only by the driver itself to differentiate which device it is operating on, just in case the driver handles more than one device.\n\nAdding a driver to your system means registering it with the kernel. This is synonymous with assigning it a major number during the module\u2019s initialization. You do this by using the `register_chrdev` function, defined by [include/linux/fs.h](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/include/linux/fs.h)\n.\n\n1int\u00a0register\\_chrdev(unsigned\u00a0int\u00a0major,\u00a0const\u00a0char\u00a0\\*name,\u00a0struct\u00a0file\\_operations\u00a0\\*fops);\n\nWhere unsigned int major is the major number you want to request, `const\u00a0char\u00a0*name` is the name of the device as it will appear in /proc/devices and `struct\u00a0file_operations\u00a0*fops` is a pointer to the `file_operations` table for your driver. A negative return value means the registration failed. Note that we didn\u2019t pass the minor number to `register_chrdev` . That is because the kernel doesn\u2019t care about the minor number; only our driver uses it.\n\nNow the question is, how do you get a major number without hijacking one that\u2019s already in use? The easiest way would be to look through [Documentation/admin-guide/devices.txt](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/Documentation/admin-guide/devices.txt)\n and pick an unused one. That is a bad way of doing things because you will never be sure if the number you picked will be assigned later. The answer is that you can ask the kernel to assign you a dynamic major number.\n\nIf you pass a major number of 0 to `register_chrdev` , the return value will be the dynamically allocated major number. The downside is that you can not make a device file in advance, since you do not know what the major number will be. There are a couple of ways to do this. First, the driver itself can print the newly assigned number and we can make the device file by hand. Second, the newly registered device will have an entry in /proc/devices, and we can either make the device file by hand or write a shell script to read the file in and make the device file. The third method is that we can have our driver make the device file using the `device_create` function after a successful registration and `device_destroy` during the call to `cleanup_module` .\n\nHowever, `register_chrdev()` would occupy a range of minor numbers associated with the given major. The recommended way to reduce waste for char device registration is using cdev interface.\n\nThe newer interface completes the char device registration in two distinct steps. First, we should register a range of device numbers, which can be completed with `register_chrdev_region` or `alloc_chrdev_region` .\n\n1int\u00a0register\\_chrdev\\_region(dev\\_t\u00a0from,\u00a0unsigned\u00a0count,\u00a0const\u00a0char\u00a0\\*name); \n2int\u00a0alloc\\_chrdev\\_region(dev\\_t\u00a0\\*dev,\u00a0unsigned\u00a0baseminor,\u00a0unsigned\u00a0count,\u00a0const\u00a0char\u00a0\\*name);\n\nThe choice between two different functions depends on whether you know the major numbers for your device. Using `register_chrdev_region` if you know the device major number and `alloc_chrdev_region` if you would like to allocate a dynamically-allocated major number.\n\nSecond, we should initialize the data structure `struct\u00a0cdev` for our char device and associate it with the device numbers. To initialize the `struct\u00a0cdev` , we can achieve by the similar sequence of the following codes.\n\n1struct\u00a0cdev\u00a0\\*my\\_dev\u00a0=\u00a0cdev\\_alloc(); \n2my\\_cdev->ops\u00a0=\u00a0&my\\_fops;\n\nHowever, the common usage pattern will embed the `struct\u00a0cdev` within a device-specific structure of your own. In this case, we\u2019ll need `cdev_init` for the initialization.\n\n1void\u00a0cdev\\_init(struct\u00a0cdev\u00a0\\*cdev,\u00a0const\u00a0struct\u00a0file\\_operations\u00a0\\*fops);\n\nOnce we finish the initialization, we can add the char device to the system by using the `cdev_add` .\n\n1int\u00a0cdev\\_add(struct\u00a0cdev\u00a0\\*p,\u00a0dev\\_t\u00a0dev,\u00a0unsigned\u00a0count);\n\nTo find an example using the interface, you can see ioctl.c described in section [9](#talking-to-device-files)\n.\n\n#### 6.4 Unregistering A Device\n\nWe can not allow the kernel module to be `rmmod` \u2019ed whenever root feels like it. If the device file is opened by a process and then we remove the kernel module, using the file would cause a call to the memory location where the appropriate function (read/write) used to be. If we are lucky, no other code was loaded there, and we\u2019ll get an ugly error message. If we are unlucky, another kernel module was loaded into the same location, which means a jump into the middle of another function within the kernel. The results of this would be impossible to predict, but they can not be very positive.\n\nNormally, when you do not want to allow something, you return an error code (a negative number) from the function which is supposed to do it. With `cleanup_module` that\u2019s impossible because it is a void function. However, there is a counter which keeps track of how many processes are using your module. You can see what its value is by looking at the 3rd field with the command `cat\u00a0/proc/modules` or `sudo\u00a0lsmod` . If this number isn\u2019t zero, `rmmod` will fail. Note that you do not have to check the counter within `cleanup_module` because the check will be performed for you by the system call `sys_delete_module` , defined in [include/linux/syscalls.h](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/include/linux/syscalls.h)\n. You should not use this counter directly, but there are functions defined in [include/linux/module.h](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/include/linux/module.h)\n which let you increase, decrease and display this counter:\n\n*   `try_module_get(THIS_MODULE)` : Increment the reference count of current module.\n*   `module_put(THIS_MODULE)` : Decrement the reference count of current module.\n*   `module_refcount(THIS_MODULE)` : Return the value of reference count of current module.\n\nIt is important to keep the counter accurate; if you ever do lose track of the correct usage count, you will never be able to unload the module; it\u2019s now reboot time, boys and girls. This is bound to happen to you sooner or later during a module\u2019s development.\n\n#### 6.5 chardev.c\n\nThe next code sample creates a char driver named chardev. You can dump its device file.\n\n1cat\u00a0/proc/devices\n\n(or open the file with a program) and the driver will put the number of times the device file has been read from into the file. We do not support writing to the file (like `echo\u00a0\"hi\"\u00a0>\u00a0/dev/hello` ), but catch these attempts and tell the user that the operation is not supported. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t see what we do with the data we read into the buffer; we don\u2019t do much with it. We simply read in the data and print a message acknowledging that we received it.\n\nIn the multiple-threaded environment, without any protection, concurrent access to the same memory may lead to the race condition, and will not preserve the performance. In the kernel module, this problem may happen due to multiple instances accessing the shared resources. Therefore, a solution is to enforce the exclusive access. We use atomic Compare-And-Swap (CAS) to maintain the states, `CDEV_NOT_USED` and `CDEV_EXCLUSIVE_OPEN` , to determine whether the file is currently opened by someone or not. CAS compares the contents of a memory location with the expected value and, only if they are the same, modifies the contents of that memory location to the desired value. See more concurrency details in the [12](#avoiding-collisions-and-deadlocks)\n section.\n\n1/\\* \n2\u00a0\\*\u00a0chardev.c:\u00a0Creates\u00a0a\u00a0read-only\u00a0char\u00a0device\u00a0that\u00a0says\u00a0how\u00a0many\u00a0times \n3\u00a0\\*\u00a0you\u00a0have\u00a0read\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0dev\u00a0file \n4\u00a0\\*/ \n5 \n6#include\u00a0<linux/atomic.h> \n7#include\u00a0<linux/cdev.h> \n8#include\u00a0<linux/delay.h> \n9#include\u00a0<linux/device.h> \n10#include\u00a0<linux/fs.h> \n11#include\u00a0<linux/init.h> \n12#include\u00a0<linux/kernel.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0for\u00a0sprintf()\u00a0\\*/ \n13#include\u00a0<linux/module.h> \n14#include\u00a0<linux/printk.h> \n15#include\u00a0<linux/types.h> \n16#include\u00a0<linux/uaccess.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0for\u00a0get\\_user\u00a0and\u00a0put\\_user\u00a0\\*/ \n17#include\u00a0<linux/version.h> \n18 \n19#include\u00a0<asm/errno.h> \n20 \n21/\\*\u00a0\u00a0Prototypes\u00a0-\u00a0this\u00a0would\u00a0normally\u00a0go\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0.h\u00a0file\u00a0\\*/ \n22static\u00a0int\u00a0device\\_open(struct\u00a0inode\u00a0\\*,\u00a0struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*);

A new system call may be added, but usually the old ones will behave exactly like they used to. This is necessary for backward compatibility \u2013 a new kernel version is not supposed to break regular processes. In most cases, the device files will also remain the same. On the other hand, the internal interfaces within the kernel can and do change between versions.\n\nThere are differences between different kernel versions, and if you want to support multiple kernel versions, you will find yourself having to code conditional compilation directives. The way to do this to compare the macro `LINUX_VERSION_CODE` to the macro `KERNEL_VERSION` . In version a.b.c of the kernel, the value of this macro would be ![216a+ 28b+ c  ](https://sysprog21.github.io/lkmpg/lkmpg-for-ht0x.svg).\n\n### 7 The /proc File System\n\nIn Linux, there is an additional mechanism for the kernel and kernel modules to send information to processes \u2014 the /proc file system. Originally designed to allow easy access to information about processes (hence the name), it is now used by every bit of the kernel which has something interesting to report, such as /proc/modules which provides the list of modules and /proc/meminfo which gathers memory usage statistics.\n\nThe method to use the proc file system is very similar to the one used with device drivers \u2014 a structure is created with all the information needed for the /proc file, including pointers to any handler functions (in our case there is only one, the one called when somebody attempts to read from the /proc file). Then, `init_module` registers the structure with the kernel and `cleanup_module` unregisters it.\n\nNormal file systems are located on a disk, rather than just in memory (which is where /proc is), and in that case the index-node (inode for short) number is a pointer to a disk location where the file\u2019s inode is located. The inode contains information about the file, for example the file\u2019s permissions, together with a pointer to the disk location or locations where the file\u2019s data can be found.\n\nBecause we don\u2019t get called when the file is opened or closed, there\u2019s nowhere for us to put `try_module_get` and `module_put` in this module, and if the file is opened and then the module is removed, there\u2019s no way to avoid the consequences.\n\nHere a simple example showing how to use a /proc file. This is the HelloWorld for the /proc filesystem. There are three parts: create the file /proc/helloworld in the function `init_module` , return a value (and a buffer) when the file /proc/helloworld is read in the callback function `procfile_read` , and delete the file /proc/helloworld in the function `cleanup_module` .\n\nThe /proc/helloworld is created when the module is loaded with the function `proc_create` . The return value is a pointer to `struct\u00a0proc_dir_entry` , and it will be used to configure the file /proc/helloworld (for example, the owner of this file). A null return value means that the creation has failed.\n\nEvery time the file /proc/helloworld is read, the function `procfile_read` is called. Two parameters of this function are very important: the buffer (the second parameter) and the offset (the fourth one). The content of the buffer will be returned to the application which read it (for example the `cat` command). The offset is the current position in the file. If the return value of the function is not null, then this function is called again. So be careful with this function, if it never returns zero, the read function is called endlessly.\n\n$\u00a0cat\u00a0/proc/helloworld\nHelloWorld!\n\n1/\\* \n2\u00a0\\*\u00a0procfs1.c \n3\u00a0\\*/ \n4 \n5#include\u00a0<linux/kernel.h> \n6#include\u00a0<linux/module.h> \n7#include\u00a0<linux/proc\\_fs.h> \n8#include\u00a0<linux/uaccess.h> \n9#include\u00a0<linux/version.h> \n10 \n11#if\u00a0LINUX\\_VERSION\\_CODE\u00a0>=\u00a0KERNEL\\_VERSION(5,\u00a06,\u00a00) \n12#define\u00a0HAVE\\_PROC\\_OPS \n13#endif \n14 \n15#define\u00a0procfs\\_name\u00a0\"helloworld\" \n16 \n17static\u00a0struct\u00a0proc\\_dir\\_entry\u00a0\\*our\\_proc\\_file; \n18 \n19static\u00a0ssize\\_t\u00a0procfile\\_read(struct\u00a0file\u00a0\\*file\\_pointer,\u00a0char\u00a0\\_\\_user\u00a0\\*buffer, \n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0size\\_t\u00a0buffer\\_length,\u00a0loff\\_t\u00a0\\*offset) \n21{ \n22\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0char\u00a0s\\[13\\]\u00a0=\u00a0\"HelloWorld!\\\\n\"; \n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0int\u00a0len\u00a0=\u00a0sizeof(s); \n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ssize\\_t\u00a0ret\u00a0=\u00a0len; \n25 \n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0if\u00a0(\\*offset\u00a0>=\u00a0len\u00a0||\u00a0copy\\_to\\_user(buffer,\u00a0s,\u00a0len))\u00a0{ \n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pr\\_info(\"copy\\_to\\_user\u00a0failed\\\\n\"); \n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ret\u00a0=\u00a00; \n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}\u00a0else\u00a0{ \n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pr\\_info(\"procfile\u00a0read\u00a0%s\\\\n\",\u00a0file\\_pointer->f\\_path.dentry->d\\_name.name); \n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\\*offset\u00a0+=\u00a0len; \n32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0} \n33 \n34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0return\u00a0ret; \n35} \n36 \n37#ifdef\u00a0HAVE\\_PROC\\_OPS \n38static\u00a0const\u00a0struct\u00a0proc\\_ops\u00a0proc\\_file\\_fops\u00a0=\u00a0{ \n39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.proc\\_read\u00a0=\u00a0procfile\\_read, \n40}; \n41#else \n42static\u00a0const\u00a0struct\u00a0file\\_operations\u00a0proc\\_file\\_fops\u00a0=\u00a0{ \n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.read\u00a0=\u00a0procfile\\_read, \n44}; \n45#endif \n46 \n47static\u00a0int\u00a0\\_\\_init\u00a0procfs1\\_init(void) \n48{ \n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0our\\_proc\\_file\u00a0=\u00a0proc\\_create(procfs\\_name,\u00a00644,\u00a0NULL,\u00a0&proc\\_file\\_fops); \n50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0if\u00a0(NULL\u00a0==\u00a0our\\_proc\\_file)\u00a0{ \n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0proc\\_remove(our\\_proc\\_file); \n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pr\\_alert(\"Error:Could\u00a0not\u00a0initialize\u00a0/proc/%s\\\\n\",\u00a0procfs\\_name); \n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0return\u00a0-ENOMEM; \n54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0} \n55 \n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pr\\_info(\"/proc/%s\u00a0created\\\\n\",\u00a0procfs\\_name); \n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0return\u00a00; \n58} \n59 \n60static\u00a0void\u00a0\\_\\_exit\u00a0procfs1\\_exit(void) \n61{ \n62\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0proc\\_remove(our\\_proc\\_file); \n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pr\\_info(\"/proc/%s\u00a0removed\\\\n\",\u00a0procfs\\_name); \n64} \n65 \n66module\\_init(procfs1\\_init); \n67module\\_exit(procfs1\\_exit); \n68 \n69MODULE\\_LICENSE(\"GPL\");\n\n#### 7.1 The proc\\_ops Structure\n\nThe `proc_ops` structure is defined in [include/linux/proc\\_fs.h](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/include/linux/proc_fs.h)\n in Linux v5.6+. In older kernels, it used `file_operations` for custom hooks in /proc file system, but it contains some members that are unnecessary in VFS, and every time VFS expands `file_operations` set, /proc code comes bloated. On the other hand, not only the space, but also some operations were saved by this structure to improve its performance. For example, the file which never disappears in /proc can set the `proc_flag` as `PROC_ENTRY_PERMANENT` to save 2 atomic ops, 1 allocation, 1 free in per open/read/close sequence.\n\n#### 7.2 Read and Write a /proc File\n\nWe have seen a very simple example for a /proc file where we only read the file /proc/helloworld. It is also possible to write in a /proc file. It works the same way as read, a function is called when the /proc file is written. But there is a little difference with read, data comes from user, so you have to import data from user space to kernel space (with `copy_from_user` or `get_user` )\n\nThe reason for `copy_from_user` or `get_user` is that Linux memory (on Intel architecture, it may be different under some other processors) is segmented. This means that a pointer, by itself, does not reference a unique location in memory, only a location in a memory segment, and you need to know which memory segment it is to be able to use it. There is one memory segment for the kernel, and one for each of the processes.\n\nThe only memory segment accessible to a process is its own, so when writing regular programs to run as processes, there is no need to worry about segments. When you write a kernel module, normally you want to access the kernel memory segment, which is handled automatically by the system. However, when the content of a memory buffer needs to be passed between the currently running process and the kernel, the kernel function receives a pointer to the memory buffer which is in the process segment. The `put_user` and `get_user` macros allow you to access that memory. These functions handle only one character, you can handle several characters with `copy_to_user` and `copy_from_user` . As the buffer (in read or write function) is in kernel space, for write function you need to import data because it comes from user space, but not for the read function because data is already in kernel space.\n\n1/\\* \n2\u00a0\\*\u00a0procfs2.c\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0create\u00a0a\u00a0\"file\"\u00a0in\u00a0/proc \n3\u00a0\\*/ \n4 \n5#include\u00a0<linux/kernel.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0We're\u00a0doing\u00a0kernel\u00a0work\u00a0\\*/ \n6#include\u00a0<linux/module.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0Specifically,\u00a0a\u00a0module\u00a0\\*/ \n7#include\u00a0<linux/proc\\_fs.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0Necessary\u00a0because\u00a0we\u00a0use\u00a0the\u00a0proc\u00a0fs\u00a0\\*/ \n8#include\u00a0<linux/uaccess.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0for\u00a0copy\\_from\\_user\u00a0\\*/ \n9#include\u00a0<linux/version.h> \n10 \n11#if\u00a0LINUX\\_VERSION\\_CODE\u00a0>=\u00a0KERNEL\\_VERSION(5,\u00a06,\u00a00) \n12#define\u00a0HAVE\\_PROC\\_OPS \n13#endif \n14 \n15#define\u00a0PROCFS\\_MAX\\_SIZE\u00a01024 \n16#define\u00a0PROCFS\\_NAME\u00a0\"buffer1k\" \n17 \n18/\\*\u00a0This\u00a0structure\u00a0hold\u00a0information\u00a0about\u00a0the\u00a0/proc\u00a0file\u00a0\\*/ \n19static\u00a0struct\u00a0proc\\_dir\\_entry\u00a0\\*our\\_proc\\_file;

But it is also possible to manage /proc file with inodes. The main concern is to use advanced functions, like permissions.\n\nIn Linux, there is a standard mechanism for file system registration. Since every file system has to have its own functions to handle inode and file operations, there is a special structure to hold pointers to all those functions, `struct\u00a0inode_operations` , which includes a pointer to `struct\u00a0proc_ops` .\n\nThe difference between file and inode operations is that file operations deal with the file itself whereas inode operations deal with ways of referencing the file, such as creating links to it.\n\nIn /proc, whenever we register a new file, we\u2019re allowed to specify which `struct\u00a0inode_operations` will be used to access to it. This is the mechanism we use, a `struct\u00a0inode_operations` which includes a pointer to a `struct\u00a0proc_ops` which includes pointers to our `procfs_read` and `procfs_write` functions.\n\nAnother interesting point here is the `module_permission` function. This function is called whenever a process tries to do something with the /proc file, and it can decide whether to allow access or not. Right now it is only based on the operation and the uid of the current user (as available in current, a pointer to a structure which includes information on the currently running process), but it could be based on anything we like, such as what other processes are doing with the same file, the time of day, or the last input we received.\n\nIt is important to note that the standard roles of read and write are reversed in the kernel. Read functions are used for output, whereas write functions are used for input. The reason for that is that read and write refer to the user\u2019s point of view \u2014 if a process reads something from the kernel, then the kernel needs to output it, and if a process writes something to the kernel, then the kernel receives it as input.\n\n1/\\* \n2\u00a0\\*\u00a0procfs3.c \n3\u00a0\\*/ \n4 \n5#include\u00a0<linux/kernel.h> \n6#include\u00a0<linux/module.h> \n7#include\u00a0<linux/proc\\_fs.h> \n8#include\u00a0<linux/sched.h> \n9#include\u00a0<linux/uaccess.h> \n10#include\u00a0<linux/version.h> \n11#if\u00a0LINUX\\_VERSION\\_CODE\u00a0>=\u00a0KERNEL\\_VERSION(5,\u00a010,\u00a00) \n12#include\u00a0<linux/minmax.h> \n13#endif \n14 \n15#if\u00a0LINUX\\_VERSION\\_CODE\u00a0>=\u00a0KERNEL\\_VERSION(5,\u00a06,\u00a00) \n16#define\u00a0HAVE\\_PROC\\_OPS \n17#endif \n18 \n19#define\u00a0PROCFS\\_MAX\\_SIZE\u00a02048UL \n20#define\u00a0PROCFS\\_ENTRY\\_FILENAME\u00a0\"buffer2k\" \n21 \n22static\u00a0struct\u00a0proc\\_dir\\_entry\u00a0\\*our\\_proc\\_file;

Well, first of all keep in mind, there are rumors around, claiming that procfs is on its way out, consider using sysfs instead. Consider using this mechanism, in case you want to document something kernel related yourself.\n\n#### 7.4 Manage /proc file with seq\\_file\n\nAs we have seen, writing a /proc file may be quite \u201ccomplex\u201d. So to help people writing /proc file, there is an API named `seq_file` that helps formatting a /proc file for output. It is based on sequence, which is composed of 3 functions: `start()` , `next()` , and `stop()` . The `seq_file` API starts a sequence when a user read the /proc file.\n\nA sequence begins with the call of the function `start()` . If the return is a non `NULL` value, the function `next()` is called; otherwise, the `stop()` function is called directly. This function is an iterator, the goal is to go through all the data. Each time `next()` is called, the function `show()` is also called. It writes data values in the buffer read by the user. The function `next()` is called until it returns `NULL` . The sequence ends when `next()` returns `NULL` , then the function `stop()` is called.\n\nBE CAREFUL: when a sequence is finished, another one starts. That means that at the end of function `stop()` , the function `start()` is called again. This loop finishes when the function `start()` returns `NULL` . You can see a scheme of this in the Figure\u00a0[1](#ignorespaces-how-seqfile-works)\n.\n\n![srrsYNNYtaenetoeooertuetupsstrxr((ntn))( tis)istrr teeaNreNatUaUtmLtLmeLmLen?e?ntntt  ](https://sysprog21.github.io/lkmpg/(ntn)\n\nFigure\u00a01:How seq\\_file works\n\nThe `seq_file` provides basic functions for `proc_ops` , such as `seq_read` , `seq_lseek` , and some others. But nothing to write in the /proc file. Of course, you can still use the same way as in the previous example.\n\n1/\\* \n2\u00a0\\*\u00a0procfs4.c\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0create\u00a0a\u00a0\"file\"\u00a0in\u00a0/proc \n3\u00a0\\*\u00a0This\u00a0program\u00a0uses\u00a0the\u00a0seq\\_file\u00a0library\u00a0to\u00a0manage\u00a0the\u00a0/proc\u00a0file. \n4\u00a0\\*/ \n5 \n6#include\u00a0<linux/kernel.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0We\u00a0are\u00a0doing\u00a0kernel\u00a0work\u00a0\\*/ \n7#include\u00a0<linux/module.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0Specifically,\u00a0a\u00a0module\u00a0\\*/ \n8#include\u00a0<linux/proc\\_fs.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0Necessary\u00a0because\u00a0we\u00a0use\u00a0proc\u00a0fs\u00a0\\*/ \n9#include\u00a0<linux/seq\\_file.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0for\u00a0seq\\_file\u00a0\\*/ \n10#include\u00a0<linux/version.h> \n11 \n12#if\u00a0LINUX\\_VERSION\\_CODE\u00a0>=\u00a0KERNEL\\_VERSION(5,\u00a06,\u00a00) \n13#define\u00a0HAVE\\_PROC\\_OPS \n14#endif \n15 \n16#define\u00a0PROC\\_NAME\u00a0\"iter\" \n17 \n18/\\*\u00a0This\u00a0function\u00a0is\u00a0called\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0beginning\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0sequence. \n19\u00a0\\*\u00a0ie,\u00a0when: \n20\u00a0\\*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0the\u00a0/proc\u00a0file\u00a0is\u00a0read\u00a0(first\u00a0time) \n21\u00a0\\*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0after\u00a0the\u00a0function\u00a0stop\u00a0(end\u00a0of\u00a0sequence) \n22\u00a0\\*/ \n23static\u00a0void\u00a0\\*my\\_seq\\_start(struct\u00a0seq\\_file\u00a0\\*s,\u00a0loff\\_t\u00a0\\*pos) \n24{ \n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0static\u00a0unsigned\u00a0long\u00a0counter\u00a0=\u00a00;

Since Linux v2.6.0, the `kobject` structure made its appearance. It was initially meant as a simple way of unifying kernel code which manages reference counted objects. After a bit of mission creep, it is now the glue that holds much of the device model and its sysfs interface together. For more information about kobject and sysfs, see [Documentation/driver-api/driver-model/driver.rst](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/Documentation/driver-api/driver-model/driver.rst)\n and [https://lwn.net/Articles/51437/](https://lwn.net/Articles/51437/)\n.\n\n### 9 Talking To Device Files\n\nDevice files are supposed to represent physical devices. Most physical devices are used for output as well as input, so there has to be some mechanism for device drivers in the kernel to get the output to send to the device from processes. This is done by opening the device file for output and writing to it, just like writing to a file. In the following example, this is implemented by `device_write` .\n\nThis is not always enough. Imagine you had a serial port connected to a modem (even if you have an internal modem, it is still implemented from the CPU\u2019s perspective as a serial port connected to a modem, so you don\u2019t have to tax your imagination too hard). The natural thing to do would be to use the device file to write things to the modem (either modem commands or data to be sent through the phone line) and read things from the modem (either responses for commands or the data received through the phone line). However, this leaves open the question of what to do when you need to talk to the serial port itself, for example to configure the rate at which data is sent and received.\n\nThe answer in Unix is to use a special function called `ioctl` (short for Input Output ConTroL). Every device can have its own `ioctl` commands, which can be read ioctl\u2019s (to send information from a process to the kernel), write ioctl\u2019s (to return information to a process), both or neither. Notice here the roles of read and write are reversed again, so in ioctl\u2019s read is to send information to the kernel and write is to receive information from the kernel.\n\nThe ioctl function is called with three parameters: the file descriptor of the appropriate device file, the ioctl number, and a parameter, which is of type long so you can use a cast to use it to pass anything. You will not be able to pass a structure this way, but you will be able to pass a pointer to the structure. Here is an example:\n\n1/\\* \n2\u00a0\\*\u00a0ioctl.c \n3\u00a0\\*/ \n4#include\u00a0<linux/cdev.h> \n5#include\u00a0<linux/fs.h> \n6#include\u00a0<linux/init.h> \n7#include\u00a0<linux/ioctl.h> \n8#include\u00a0<linux/module.h> \n9#include\u00a0<linux/slab.h> \n10#include\u00a0<linux/uaccess.h> \n11#include\u00a0<linux/version.h> \n12 \n13struct\u00a0ioctl\\_arg\u00a0{ \n14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0unsigned\u00a0int\u00a0val;

It is the ioctl number. The ioctl number encodes the major device number, the type of the ioctl, the command, and the type of the parameter. This ioctl number is usually created by a macro call ( `_IO` , `_IOR` , `_IOW` or `_IOWR` \u2014 depending on the type) in a header file. This header file should then be included both by the programs which will use ioctl (so they can generate the appropriate ioctl\u2019s) and by the kernel module (so it can understand it). In the example below, the header file is chardev.h and the program which uses it is userspace\\_ioctl.c.\n\nIf you want to use ioctls in your own kernel modules, it is best to receive an official ioctl assignment, so if you accidentally get somebody else\u2019s ioctls, or if they get yours, you\u2019ll know something is wrong. For more information, consult the kernel source tree at [Documentation/userspace-api/ioctl/ioctl-number.rst](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/Documentation/userspace-api/ioctl/ioctl-number.rst)\n.\n\nAlso, we need to be careful that concurrent access to the shared resources will lead to the race condition. The solution is using atomic Compare-And-Swap (CAS), which we mentioned at [6.5](#chardevc)\n section, to enforce the exclusive access.\n\n1/\\* \n2\u00a0\\*\u00a0chardev2.c\u00a0-\u00a0Create\u00a0an\u00a0input/output\u00a0character\u00a0device \n3\u00a0\\*/ \n4 \n5#include\u00a0<linux/atomic.h> \n6#include\u00a0<linux/cdev.h> \n7#include\u00a0<linux/delay.h> \n8#include\u00a0<linux/device.h> \n9#include\u00a0<linux/fs.h> \n10#include\u00a0<linux/init.h> \n11#include\u00a0<linux/module.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0Specifically,\u00a0a\u00a0module\u00a0\\*/ \n12#include\u00a0<linux/printk.h> \n13#include\u00a0<linux/types.h> \n14#include\u00a0<linux/uaccess.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0for\u00a0get\\_user\u00a0and\u00a0put\\_user\u00a0\\*/ \n15#include\u00a0<linux/version.h> \n16 \n17#include\u00a0<asm/errno.h> \n18 \n19#include\u00a0\"chardev.h\" \n20#define\u00a0SUCCESS\u00a00 \n21#define\u00a0DEVICE\\_NAME\u00a0\"char\\_dev\" \n22#define\u00a0BUF\\_LEN\u00a080 \n23 \n24enum\u00a0{ \n25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CDEV\\_NOT\\_USED\u00a0=\u00a00, \n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CDEV\\_EXCLUSIVE\\_OPEN\u00a0=\u00a01, \n27};

\n103}\n\n### 10 System Calls\n\nSo far, the only thing we\u2019ve done was to use well defined kernel mechanisms to register /proc files and device handlers. This is fine if you want to do something the kernel programmers thought you\u2019d want, such as write a device driver. But what if you want to do something unusual, to change the behavior of the system in some way? Then, you are mostly on your own.\n\nShould one choose not to use a virtual machine, kernel programming can become risky. For example, while writing the code below, the `open()` system call was inadvertently disrupted. This resulted in an inability to open any files, run programs, or shut down the system, necessitating a restart of the virtual machine. Fortunately, no critical files were lost in this instance. However, if such modifications were made on a live, mission-critical system, the consequences could be severe. To mitigate the risk of file loss, even in a test environment, it is advised to execute `sync` right before using `insmod` and `rmmod` .\n\nForget about /proc files, forget about device files. They are just minor details. Minutiae in the vast expanse of the universe. The real process to kernel communication mechanism, the one used by all processes, is system calls. When a process requests a service from the kernel (such as opening a file, forking to a new process, or requesting more memory), this is the mechanism used. If you want to change the behaviour of the kernel in interesting ways, this is the place to do it. By the way, if you want to see which system calls a program uses, run `strace\u00a0<arguments>` .\n\nIn general, a process is not supposed to be able to access the kernel. It can not access kernel memory and it can\u2019t call kernel functions. The hardware of the CPU enforces this (that is the reason why it is called \u201cprotected mode\u201d or \u201cpage protection\u201d).\n\nSystem calls are an exception to this general rule. What happens is that the process fills the registers with the appropriate values and then calls a special instruction which jumps to a previously defined location in the kernel (of course, that location is readable by user processes, it is not writable by them). Under Intel CPUs, this is done by means of interrupt 0x80. The hardware knows that once you jump to this location, you are no longer running in restricted user mode, but as the operating system kernel \u2014 and therefore you\u2019re allowed to do whatever you want.\n\nThe location in the kernel a process can jump to is called system\\_call. The procedure at that location checks the system call number, which tells the kernel what service the process requested. Then, it looks at the table of system calls ( `sys_call_table` ) to see the address of the kernel function to call. Then it calls the function, and after it returns, does a few system checks and then return back to the process (or to a different process, if the process time ran out). If you want to read this code, it is at the source file arch/$(architecture)/kernel/entry.S, after the line `ENTRY(system_call)` .\n\nSo, if we want to change the way a certain system call works, what we need to do is to write our own function to implement it (usually by adding a bit of our own code, and then calling the original function) and then change the pointer at `sys_call_table` to point to our function. Because we might be removed later and we don\u2019t want to leave the system in an unstable state, it\u2019s important for `cleanup_module` to restore the table to its original state.\n\nTo modify the content of `sys_call_table` , we need to consider the control register. A control register is a processor register that changes or controls the general behavior of the CPU. For x86 architecture, the cr0 register has various control flags that modify the basic operation of the processor. The WP flag in cr0 stands for write protection. Once the WP flag is set, the processor disallows further write attempts to the read-only sections Therefore, we must disable the WP flag before modifying `sys_call_table` . Since Linux v5.3, the `write_cr0` function cannot be used because of the sensitive cr0 bits pinned by the security issue, the attacker may write into CPU control registers to disable CPU protections like write protection. As a result, we have to provide the custom assembly routine to bypass it.\n\nHowever, `sys_call_table` symbol is unexported to prevent misuse. But there have few ways to get the symbol, manual symbol lookup and `kallsyms_lookup_name` . Here we use both depend on the kernel version.\n\nBecause of the control-flow integrity, which is a technique to prevent the redirect execution code from the attacker, for making sure that the indirect calls go to the expected addresses and the return addresses are not changed. Since Linux v5.7, the kernel patched the series of control-flow enforcement (CET) for x86, and some configurations of GCC, like GCC versions 9 and 10 in Ubuntu Linux, will add with CET (the \\-fcf-protection option) in the kernel by default. Using that GCC to compile the kernel with retpoline off may result in CET being enabled in the kernel. You can use the following command to check out the \\-fcf-protection option is enabled or not:\n\n$\u00a0gcc\u00a0-v\u00a0-Q\u00a0-O2\u00a0--help=target\u00a0|\u00a0grep\u00a0protection\nUsing\u00a0built-in\u00a0specs.\nCOLLECT\\_GCC=gcc\nCOLLECT\\_LTO\\_WRAPPER=/usr/lib/gcc/x86\\_64-linux-gnu/9/lto-wrapper\n...\ngcc\u00a0version\u00a09.3.0\u00a0(Ubuntu\u00a09.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04)\nCOLLECT\\_GCC\\_OPTIONS='-v'\u00a0'-Q'\u00a0'-O2'\u00a0'--help=target'\u00a0'-mtune=generic'\u00a0'-march=x86-64'\n\u00a0/usr/lib/gcc/x86\\_64-linux-gnu/9/cc1\u00a0-v\u00a0...\u00a0-fcf-protection\u00a0...\n\u00a0GNU\u00a0C17\u00a0(Ubuntu\u00a09.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04)\u00a0version\u00a09.3.0\u00a0(x86\\_64-linux-gnu)\n...\n\nBut CET should not be enabled in the kernel, it may break the Kprobes and bpf. Consequently, CET is disabled since v5.11. To guarantee the manual symbol lookup worked, we only use up to v5.4.\n\nUnfortunately, since Linux v5.7 `kallsyms_lookup_name` is also unexported, it needs certain trick to get the address of `kallsyms_lookup_name` . If `CONFIG_KPROBES` is enabled, we can facilitate the retrieval of function addresses by means of Kprobes to dynamically break into the specific kernel routine. Kprobes inserts a breakpoint at the entry of function by replacing the first bytes of the probed instruction. When a CPU hits the breakpoint, registers are stored, and the control will pass to Kprobes. It passes the addresses of the saved registers and the Kprobe struct to the handler you defined, then executes it. Kprobes can be registered by symbol name or address. Within the symbol name, the address will be handled by the kernel.\n\nOtherwise, specify the address of `sys_call_table` from /proc/kallsyms and /boot/System.map into `sym` parameter. Following is the sample usage for /proc/kallsyms:\n\n$\u00a0sudo\u00a0grep\u00a0sys\\_call\\_table\u00a0/proc/kallsyms\nffffffff82000280\u00a0R\u00a0x32\\_sys\\_call\\_table\nffffffff820013a0\u00a0R\u00a0sys\\_call\\_table\nffffffff820023e0\u00a0R\u00a0ia32\\_sys\\_call\\_table\n$\u00a0sudo\u00a0insmod\u00a0syscall-steal.ko\u00a0sym=0xffffffff820013a0\n\nUsing the address from /boot/System.map, be careful about KASLR (Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization). KASLR may randomize the address of kernel code and data at every boot time, such as the static address listed in /boot/System.map will offset by some entropy. The purpose of KASLR is to protect the kernel space from the attacker. Without KASLR, the attacker may find the target address in the fixed address easily. Then the attacker can use return-oriented programming to insert some malicious codes to execute or receive the target data by a tampered pointer. KASLR mitigates these kinds of attacks because the attacker cannot immediately know the target address, but a brute-force attack can still work. If the address of a symbol in /proc/kallsyms is different from the address in /boot/System.map, KASLR is enabled with the kernel, which your system running on.\n\n$\u00a0grep\u00a0GRUB\\_CMDLINE\\_LINUX\\_DEFAULT\u00a0/etc/default/grub\nGRUB\\_CMDLINE\\_LINUX\\_DEFAULT=\"quiet\u00a0splash\"\n$\u00a0sudo\u00a0grep\u00a0sys\\_call\\_table\u00a0/boot/System.map-$(uname\u00a0-r)\nffffffff82000300\u00a0R\u00a0sys\\_call\\_table\n$\u00a0sudo\u00a0grep\u00a0sys\\_call\\_table\u00a0/proc/kallsyms\nffffffff820013a0\u00a0R\u00a0sys\\_call\\_table\n#\u00a0Reboot\n$\u00a0sudo\u00a0grep\u00a0sys\\_call\\_table\u00a0/boot/System.map-$(uname\u00a0-r)\nffffffff82000300\u00a0R\u00a0sys\\_call\\_table\n$\u00a0sudo\u00a0grep\u00a0sys\\_call\\_table\u00a0/proc/kallsyms\nffffffff86400300\u00a0R\u00a0sys\\_call\\_table\n\nIf KASLR is enabled, we have to take care of the address from /proc/kallsyms each time we reboot the machine. In order to use the address from /boot/System.map, make sure that KASLR is disabled.

We want to \u201cspy\u201d on a certain user, and to `pr_info()` a message whenever that user opens a file. Towards this end, we replace the system call to open a file with our own function, called `our_sys_openat` . This function checks the uid (user\u2019s id) of the current process, and if it is equal to the uid we spy on, it calls `pr_info()` to display the name of the file to be opened. Then, either way, it calls the original `openat()` function with the same parameters, to actually open the file.\n\nThe `init_module` function replaces the appropriate location in `sys_call_table` and keeps the original pointer in a variable. The `cleanup_module` function uses that variable to restore everything back to normal. This approach is dangerous, because of the possibility of two kernel modules changing the same system call. Imagine we have two kernel modules, A and B. A\u2019s openat system call will be `A_openat` and B\u2019s will be `B_openat` . Now, when A is inserted into the kernel, the system call is replaced with `A_openat` , which will call the original `sys_openat` when it is done. Next, B is inserted into the kernel, which replaces the system call with `B_openat` , which will call what it thinks is the original system call, `A_openat` , when it\u2019s done.\n\nNow, if B is removed first, everything will be well \u2014 it will simply restore the system call to `A_openat` , which calls the original. However, if A is removed and then B is removed, the system will crash. A\u2019s removal will restore the system call to the original, `sys_openat` , cutting B out of the loop. Then, when B is removed, it will restore the system call to what it thinks is the original, `A_openat` , which is no longer in memory. At first glance, it appears we could solve this particular problem by checking if the system call is equal to our open function and if so not changing it at all (so that B won\u2019t change the system call when it is removed), but that will cause an even worse problem. When A is removed, it sees that the system call was changed to `B_openat` so that it is no longer pointing to `A_openat` , so it will not restore it to `sys_openat` before it is removed from memory. Unfortunately, `B_openat` will still try to call `A_openat` which is no longer there, so that even without removing B the system would crash.\n\nFor x86 architecture, the system call table cannot be used to invoke a system call after commit [1e3ad78](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=1e3ad78334a69b36e107232e337f9d693dcc9df2)\n since v6.9. This commit has been backported to long term stable kernels, like v5.15.154+, v6.1.85+, v6.6.26+ and v6.8.5+, see this [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/78607015)\n for more details. In this case, thanks to Kprobes, a hook can be used instead on the system call entry to intercept the system call.\n\nNote that all the related problems make syscall stealing unfeasible for production use. In order to keep people from doing potential harmful things `sys_call_table` is no longer exported. This means, if you want to do something more than a mere dry run of this example, you will have to patch your current kernel in order to have `sys_call_table` exported.\n\n1/\\* \n2\u00a0\\*\u00a0syscall-steal.c \n3\u00a0\\* \n4\u00a0\\*\u00a0System\u00a0call\u00a0\"stealing\"\u00a0sample. \n5\u00a0\\* \n6\u00a0\\*\u00a0Disables\u00a0page\u00a0protection\u00a0at\u00a0a\u00a0processor\u00a0level\u00a0by\u00a0changing\u00a0the\u00a016th\u00a0bit \n7\u00a0\\*\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0cr0\u00a0register\u00a0(could\u00a0be\u00a0Intel\u00a0specific). \n8\u00a0\\*/ \n9 \n10#include\u00a0<linux/delay.h> \n11#include\u00a0<linux/kernel.h> \n12#include\u00a0<linux/module.h> \n13#include\u00a0<linux/moduleparam.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0which\u00a0will\u00a0have\u00a0params\u00a0\\*/ \n14#include\u00a0<linux/unistd.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0The\u00a0list\u00a0of\u00a0system\u00a0calls\u00a0\\*/ \n15#include\u00a0<linux/cred.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0For\u00a0current\\_uid()\u00a0\\*/ \n16#include\u00a0<linux/uidgid.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0For\u00a0\\_\\_kuid\\_val()\u00a0\\*/ \n17#include\u00a0<linux/version.h> \n18 \n19/\\*\u00a0For\u00a0the\u00a0current\u00a0(process)\u00a0structure,\u00a0we\u00a0need\u00a0this\u00a0to\u00a0know\u00a0who\u00a0the \n20\u00a0\\*\u00a0current\u00a0user\u00a0is. \n21\u00a0\\*/ \n22#include\u00a0<linux/sched.h> \n23#include\u00a0<linux/uaccess.h> \n24 \n25/\\*\u00a0The\u00a0way\u00a0we\u00a0access\u00a0\"sys\\_call\\_table\"\u00a0varies\u00a0as\u00a0kernel\u00a0internal\u00a0changes. \n26\u00a0\\*\u00a0-\u00a0Prior\u00a0to\u00a0v5.4\u00a0:\u00a0manual\u00a0symbol\u00a0lookup \n27\u00a0\\*\u00a0-\u00a0v5.5\u00a0to\u00a0v5.6\u00a0\u00a0:\u00a0use\u00a0kallsyms\\_lookup\\_name() \n28\u00a0\\*\u00a0-\u00a0v5.7+\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0:\u00a0Kprobes\u00a0or\u00a0specific\u00a0kernel\u00a0module\u00a0parameter \n29\u00a0\\*/ \n30 \n31/\\*\u00a0The\u00a0in-kernel\u00a0calls\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0ksys\\_close()\u00a0syscall\u00a0were\u00a0removed\u00a0in\u00a0Linux\u00a0v5.11+. \n32\u00a0\\*/ \n33#if\u00a0(LINUX\\_VERSION\\_CODE\u00a0<\u00a0KERNEL\\_VERSION(5,\u00a07,\u00a00)) \n34 \n35#if\u00a0LINUX\\_VERSION\\_CODE\u00a0<=\u00a0KERNEL\\_VERSION(5,\u00a04,\u00a00) \n36#define\u00a0HAVE\\_KSYS\\_CLOSE\u00a01 \n37#include\u00a0<linux/syscalls.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0For\u00a0ksys\\_close()\u00a0\\*/ \n38#else \n39#include\u00a0<linux/kallsyms.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0For\u00a0kallsyms\\_lookup\\_name\u00a0\\*/ \n40#endif \n41 \n42#else \n43 \n44#if\u00a0defined(CONFIG\\_KPROBES) \n45#define\u00a0HAVE\\_KPROBES\u00a01 \n46#if\u00a0defined(CONFIG\\_X86\\_64) \n47/\\*\u00a0If\u00a0you\u00a0have\u00a0tried\u00a0to\u00a0use\u00a0the\u00a0syscall\u00a0table\u00a0to\u00a0intercept\u00a0syscalls\u00a0and\u00a0it\u00a0 \n48\u00a0\\*\u00a0doesn't\u00a0work,\u00a0you\u00a0can\u00a0try\u00a0to\u00a0use\u00a0Kprobes\u00a0to\u00a0intercept\u00a0syscalls. \n49\u00a0\\*\u00a0Set\u00a0USE\\_KPROBES\\_PRE\\_HANDLER\\_BEFORE\\_SYSCALL\u00a0to\u00a01\u00a0to\u00a0register\u00a0a\u00a0pre-handler \n50\u00a0\\*\u00a0before\u00a0the\u00a0syscall. \n51\u00a0\\*/ \n52#define\u00a0USE\\_KPROBES\\_PRE\\_HANDLER\\_BEFORE\\_SYSCALL\u00a00 \n53#endif \n54#include\u00a0<linux/kprobes.h> \n55#else \n56#define\u00a0HAVE\\_PARAM\u00a01 \n57#include\u00a0<linux/kallsyms.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0For\u00a0sprint\\_symbol\u00a0\\*/ \n58/\\*\u00a0The\u00a0address\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0sys\\_call\\_table,\u00a0which\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0obtained\u00a0with\u00a0looking\u00a0up \n59\u00a0\\*\u00a0\"/boot/System.map\"\u00a0or\u00a0\"/proc/kallsyms\".\u00a0When\u00a0the\u00a0kernel\u00a0version\u00a0is\u00a0v5.7+, \n60\u00a0\\*\u00a0without\u00a0CONFIG\\_KPROBES,\u00a0you\u00a0can\u00a0input\u00a0the\u00a0parameter\u00a0or\u00a0the\u00a0module\u00a0will\u00a0look \n61\u00a0\\*\u00a0up\u00a0all\u00a0the\u00a0memory. \n62\u00a0\\*/ \n63static\u00a0unsigned\u00a0long\u00a0sym\u00a0=\u00a00;

If you are a human being and you are bothered by a human being, the only thing you can say is: \"Not right now, I\u2019m busy. Go away!\". But if you are a kernel module and you are bothered by a process, you have another possibility. You can put the process to sleep until you can service it. After all, processes are being put to sleep by the kernel and woken up all the time (that is the way multiple processes appear to run on the same time on a single CPU).\n\nThis kernel module is an example of this. The file (called /proc/sleep) can only be opened by a single process at a time. If the file is already open, the kernel module calls `wait_event_interruptible` . The easiest way to keep a file open is to open it with:\n\n1tail\u00a0-f\n\nThis function changes the status of the task (a task is the kernel data structure which holds information about a process and the system call it is in, if any) to `TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE` , which means that the task will not run until it is woken up somehow, and adds it to WaitQ, the queue of tasks waiting to access the file. Then, the function calls the scheduler to context switch to a different process, one which has some use for the CPU.\n\nWhen a process is done with the file, it closes it, and `module_close` is called. That function wakes up all the processes in the queue (there\u2019s no mechanism to only wake up one of them). It then returns and the process which just closed the file can continue to run. In time, the scheduler decides that that process has had enough and gives control of the CPU to another process. Eventually, one of the processes which was in the queue will be given control of the CPU by the scheduler. It starts at the point right after the call to `wait_event_interruptible` .\n\nThis means that the process is still in kernel mode - as far as the process is concerned, it issued the open system call and the system call has not returned yet. The process does not know somebody else used the CPU for most of the time between the moment it issued the call and the moment it returned.\n\nIt can then proceed to set a global variable to tell all the other processes that the file is still open and go on with its life. When the other processes get a piece of the CPU, they\u2019ll see that global variable and go back to sleep.\n\nSo we will use `tail\u00a0-f` to keep the file open in the background, while trying to access it with another process (again in the background, so that we need not switch to a different vt). As soon as the first background process is killed with kill %1 , the second is woken up, is able to access the file and finally terminates.\n\nTo make our life more interesting, `module_close` does not have a monopoly on waking up the processes which wait to access the file. A signal, such as Ctrl +c (SIGINT) can also wake up a process. This is because we used `wait_event_interruptible` . We could have used `wait_event` instead, but that would have resulted in extremely angry users whose Ctrl+c\u2019s are ignored.\n\nIn that case, we want to return with `-EINTR` immediately. This is important so users can, for example, kill the process before it receives the file.\n\nThere is one more point to remember. Some times processes don\u2019t want to sleep, they want either to get what they want immediately, or to be told it cannot be done. Such processes use the `O_NONBLOCK` flag when opening the file. The kernel is supposed to respond by returning with the error code `-EAGAIN` from operations which would otherwise block, such as opening the file in this example. The program `cat_nonblock` , available in the examples/other directory, can be used to open a file with `O_NONBLOCK` .\n\n$\u00a0sudo\u00a0insmod\u00a0sleep.ko\n$\u00a0cat\\_nonblock\u00a0/proc/sleep\nLast\u00a0input:\n$\u00a0tail\u00a0-f\u00a0/proc/sleep\u00a0&\nLast\u00a0input:\nLast\u00a0input:\nLast\u00a0input:\nLast\u00a0input:\nLast\u00a0input:\nLast\u00a0input:\nLast\u00a0input:\ntail:\u00a0/proc/sleep:\u00a0file\u00a0truncated\n\\[1\\]\u00a06540\n$\u00a0cat\\_nonblock\u00a0/proc/sleep\nOpen\u00a0would\u00a0block\n$\u00a0kill\u00a0%1\n\\[1\\]+\u00a0\u00a0Terminated\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0tail\u00a0-f\u00a0/proc/sleep\n$\u00a0cat\\_nonblock\u00a0/proc/sleep\nLast\u00a0input:\n$\n\n1/\\* \n2\u00a0\\*\u00a0sleep.c\u00a0-\u00a0create\u00a0a\u00a0/proc\u00a0file,\u00a0and\u00a0if\u00a0several\u00a0processes\u00a0try\u00a0to\u00a0open\u00a0it \n3\u00a0\\*\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0same\u00a0time,\u00a0put\u00a0all\u00a0but\u00a0one\u00a0to\u00a0sleep. \n4\u00a0\\*/ \n5 \n6#include\u00a0<linux/atomic.h> \n7#include\u00a0<linux/fs.h> \n8#include\u00a0<linux/kernel.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0for\u00a0sprintf()\u00a0\\*/ \n9#include\u00a0<linux/module.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0Specifically,\u00a0a\u00a0module\u00a0\\*/ \n10#include\u00a0<linux/printk.h> \n11#include\u00a0<linux/proc\\_fs.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0Necessary\u00a0because\u00a0we\u00a0use\u00a0proc\u00a0fs\u00a0\\*/ \n12#include\u00a0<linux/types.h> \n13#include\u00a0<linux/uaccess.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0for\u00a0get\\_user\u00a0and\u00a0put\\_user\u00a0\\*/ \n14#include\u00a0<linux/version.h> \n15#include\u00a0<linux/wait.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0For\u00a0putting\u00a0processes\u00a0to\u00a0sleep\u00a0and \n16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0waking\u00a0them\u00a0up\u00a0\\*/  \n17  \n18#include\u00a0<asm/current.h> \n19#include\u00a0<asm/errno.h> \n20 \n21#if\u00a0LINUX\\_VERSION\\_CODE\u00a0>=\u00a0KERNEL\\_VERSION(5,\u00a06,\u00a00) \n22#define\u00a0HAVE\\_PROC\\_OPS \n23#endif \n24 \n25/\\*\u00a0Here\u00a0we\u00a0keep\u00a0the\u00a0last\u00a0message\u00a0received,\u00a0to\u00a0prove\u00a0that\u00a0we\u00a0can\u00a0process\u00a0our \n26\u00a0\\*\u00a0input. \n27\u00a0\\*/ \n28#define\u00a0MESSAGE\\_LENGTH\u00a080 \n29static\u00a0char\u00a0message\\[MESSAGE\\_LENGTH\\];

Rather than using `/bin/sleep` commands, the kernel has another way to do this which allows timeouts or interrupts to also happen.\n\nCompletions as code synchronization mechanism have three main parts, initialization of struct completion synchronization object, the waiting or barrier part through `wait_for_completion()` , and the signalling side through a call to `complete()` .\n\nIn the subsequent example, two threads are initiated: crank and flywheel. It is imperative that the crank thread starts before the flywheel thread. A completion state is established for each of these threads, with a distinct completion defined for both the crank and flywheel threads. At the exit point of each thread the respective completion state is updated, and `wait_for_completion` is used by the flywheel thread to ensure that it does not begin prematurely. The crank thread uses the `complete_all()` function to update the completion, which lets the flywheel thread continue.\n\nSo even though `flywheel_thread` is started first you should notice when you load this module and run `dmesg` , that turning the crank always happens first because the flywheel thread waits for the crank thread to complete.\n\nThere are other variations of the `wait_for_completion` function, which include timeouts or being interrupted, but this basic mechanism is enough for many common situations without adding a lot of complexity.\n\n1/\\* \n2\u00a0\\*\u00a0completions.c \n3\u00a0\\*/ \n4#include\u00a0<linux/completion.h> \n5#include\u00a0<linux/err.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0for\u00a0IS\\_ERR()\u00a0\\*/ \n6#include\u00a0<linux/init.h> \n7#include\u00a0<linux/kthread.h> \n8#include\u00a0<linux/module.h> \n9#include\u00a0<linux/printk.h> \n10#include\u00a0<linux/version.h> \n11 \n12static\u00a0struct\u00a0completion\u00a0crank\\_comp; \n13static\u00a0struct\u00a0completion\u00a0flywheel\\_comp; \n14 \n15static\u00a0int\u00a0machine\\_crank\\_thread(void\u00a0\\*arg) \n16{ \n17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pr\\_info(\"Turn\u00a0the\u00a0crank\\\\n\"); \n18 \n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0complete\\_all(&crank\\_comp); \n20#if\u00a0LINUX\\_VERSION\\_CODE\u00a0>=\u00a0KERNEL\\_VERSION(5,\u00a017,\u00a00) \n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0kthread\\_complete\\_and\\_exit(&crank\\_comp,\u00a00); \n22#else \n23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0complete\\_and\\_exit(&crank\\_comp,\u00a00); \n24#endif \n25} \n26 \n27static\u00a0int\u00a0machine\\_flywheel\\_spinup\\_thread(void\u00a0\\*arg) \n28{ \n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0wait\\_for\\_completion(&crank\\_comp); \n30 \n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pr\\_info(\"Flywheel\u00a0spins\u00a0up\\\\n\"); \n32 \n33\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0complete\\_all(&flywheel\\_comp); \n34#if\u00a0LINUX\\_VERSION\\_CODE\u00a0>=\u00a0KERNEL\\_VERSION(5,\u00a017,\u00a00) \n35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0kthread\\_complete\\_and\\_exit(&flywheel\\_comp,\u00a00); \n36#else \n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0complete\\_and\\_exit(&flywheel\\_comp,\u00a00); \n38#endif \n39} \n40 \n41static\u00a0int\u00a0\\_\\_init\u00a0completions\\_init(void) \n42{ \n43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0struct\u00a0task\\_struct\u00a0\\*crank\\_thread; \n44\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0struct\u00a0task\\_struct\u00a0\\*flywheel\\_thread; \n45 \n46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pr\\_info(\"completions\u00a0example\\\\n\"); \n47 \n48\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0init\\_completion(&crank\\_comp); \n49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0init\\_completion(&flywheel\\_comp); \n50 \n51\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0crank\\_thread\u00a0=\u00a0kthread\\_create(machine\\_crank\\_thread,\u00a0NULL,\u00a0\"KThread\u00a0Crank\"); \n52\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0if\u00a0(IS\\_ERR(crank\\_thread)) \n53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0goto\u00a0ERROR\\_THREAD\\_1; \n54 \n55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0flywheel\\_thread\u00a0=\u00a0kthread\\_create(machine\\_flywheel\\_spinup\\_thread,\u00a0NULL, \n56\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"KThread\u00a0Flywheel\"); \n57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0if\u00a0(IS\\_ERR(flywheel\\_thread)) \n58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0goto\u00a0ERROR\\_THREAD\\_2; \n59 \n60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0wake\\_up\\_process(flywheel\\_thread); \n61\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0wake\\_up\\_process(crank\\_thread); \n62 \n63\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0return\u00a00; \n64 \n65ERROR\\_THREAD\\_2: \n66\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0kthread\\_stop(crank\\_thread); \n67ERROR\\_THREAD\\_1: \n68 \n69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0return\u00a0-1; \n70} \n71 \n72static\u00a0void\u00a0\\_\\_exit\u00a0completions\\_exit(void) \n73{ \n74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0wait\\_for\\_completion(&crank\\_comp); \n75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0wait\\_for\\_completion(&flywheel\\_comp); \n76 \n77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pr\\_info(\"completions\u00a0exit\\\\n\"); \n78} \n79 \n80module\\_init(completions\\_init); \n81module\\_exit(completions\\_exit); \n82 \n83MODULE\\_DESCRIPTION(\"Completions\u00a0example\"); \n84MODULE\\_LICENSE(\"GPL\");\n\n### 12 Avoiding Collisions and Deadlocks\n\nIf processes running on different CPUs or in different threads try to access the same memory, then it is possible that strange things can happen or your system can lock up. To avoid this, various types of mutual exclusion kernel functions are available. These indicate if a section of code is \"locked\" or \"unlocked\" so that simultaneous attempts to run it can not happen.\n\n#### 12.1 Mutex\n\nYou can use kernel mutexes (mutual exclusions) in much the same manner that you might deploy them in userland.

Situations where the kernel code monopolizes a CPU are called atomic contexts. Holding a spinlock is one of those situations. Sleeping in atomic contexts may leave the system hanging, as the occupied CPU devotes 100% of its resources doing nothing but sleeping. In some worse cases the system may crash. Thus, sleeping in atomic contexts is considered a bug in the kernel. They are sometimes called \u201csleep-in-atomic-context\u201d in some materials.\n\nNote that sleeping here is not limited to calling the sleep functions explicitly. If subsequent function calls eventually invoke a function that sleeps, it is also considered sleeping. Thus, it is important to pay attention to functions being used in atomic context. There\u2019s no documentation recording all such functions, but code comments may help. Sometimes you may find comments in kernel source code stating that a function \u201cmay sleep\u201d, \u201cmight sleep\u201d, or more explicitly \u201cthe caller should not hold a spinlock\u201d. Those comments are hints that a function may implicitly sleep and must not be called in atomic contexts.\n\n#### 12.3 Read and write locks\n\nRead and write locks are specialised kinds of spinlocks so that you can exclusively read from something or write to something. Like the earlier spinlocks example, the one below shows an \"irq safe\" situation in which if other functions were triggered from irqs which might also read and write to whatever you are concerned with then they would not disrupt the logic.

Implementing the atomic types by C11 atomics may allow the kernel to throw away the architecture-specific codes and letting the kernel code be more friendly to the people who understand the standard. But there are some problems, such as the memory model of the kernel doesn\u2019t match the model formed by the C11 atomics. For further details, see:\n\n*   [kernel documentation of atomic types](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/atomic_t.txt)\n    \n*   [Time to move to C11 atomics?](https://lwn.net/Articles/691128/)\n    \n*   [Atomic usage patterns in the kernel](https://lwn.net/Articles/698315/)\n    \n\n### 13 Replacing Print Macros\n\n#### 13.1 Replacement\n\nIn Section [1.7](#before-we-begin)\n, it was noted that the X Window System and kernel module programming are not conducive to integration. This remains valid during the development of kernel modules. However, in practical scenarios, the necessity emerges to relay messages to the tty (teletype) originating the module load command.\n\nThe term \u201ctty\u201d originates from teletype, which initially referred to a combined keyboard-printer for Unix system communication. Today, it signifies a text stream abstraction employed by Unix programs, encompassing physical terminals, xterms in X displays, and network connections like SSH.\n\nTo achieve this, the \u201ccurrent\u201d pointer is leveraged to access the active task\u2019s tty structure.

Flashing keyboard LEDs can be such a solution: It is an immediate way to attract attention or to display a status condition. Keyboard LEDs are present on every hardware, they are always visible, they do not need any setup, and their use is rather simple and non-intrusive, compared to writing to a tty or a file.\n\nFrom v4.14 to v4.15, the timer API made a series of changes to improve memory safety. A buffer overflow in the area of a `timer_list` structure may be able to overwrite the `function` and `data` fields, providing the attacker with a way to use return-oriented programming (ROP) to call arbitrary functions within the kernel. Also, the function prototype of the callback, containing a `unsigned\u00a0long` argument, will prevent work from any type checking. Furthermore, the function prototype with `unsigned\u00a0long` argument may be an obstacle to the forward-edge protection of control-flow integrity. Thus, it is better to use a unique prototype to separate from the cluster that takes an `unsigned\u00a0long` argument. The timer callback should be passed a pointer to the `timer_list` structure rather than an `unsigned\u00a0long` argument. Then, it wraps all the information the callback needs, including the `timer_list` structure, into a larger structure, and it can use the `container_of` macro instead of the `unsigned\u00a0long` value. For more information see: [Improving the kernel timers API](https://lwn.net/Articles/735887/)\n.\n\nBefore Linux v4.14, `setup_timer` was used to initialize the timer and the `timer_list` structure looked like:\n\n1struct\u00a0timer\\_list\u00a0{ \n2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0unsigned\u00a0long\u00a0expires; \n3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0void\u00a0(\\*function)(unsigned\u00a0long); \n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0unsigned\u00a0long\u00a0data; \n5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0u32\u00a0flags; \n6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/\\*\u00a0...\u00a0\\*/ \n7}; \n8 \n9void\u00a0setup\\_timer(struct\u00a0timer\\_list\u00a0\\*timer,\u00a0void\u00a0(\\*callback)(unsigned\u00a0long), \n10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0unsigned\u00a0long\u00a0data);\n\nSince Linux v4.14, `timer_setup` is adopted and the kernel step by step converting to `timer_setup` from `setup_timer` . One of the reasons why API was changed is it need to coexist with the old version interface. Moreover, the `timer_setup` was implemented by `setup_timer` at first.\n\n1void\u00a0timer\\_setup(struct\u00a0timer\\_list\u00a0\\*timer, \n2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0void\u00a0(\\*callback)(struct\u00a0timer\\_list\u00a0\\*),\u00a0unsigned\u00a0int\u00a0flags);\n\nThe `setup_timer` was then removed since v4.15.

Ever wondered what `CONFIG_LL_DEBUG` in `make\u00a0menuconfig` is good for? If you activate that you get low level access to the serial port. While this might not sound very powerful by itself, you can patch [kernel/printk.c](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/kernel/printk.c)\n or any other essential syscall to print ASCII characters, thus making it possible to trace virtually everything what your code does over a serial line. If you find yourself porting the kernel to some new and former unsupported architecture, this is usually amongst the first things that should be implemented. Logging over a netconsole might also be worth a try.\n\nWhile you have seen lots of stuff that can be used to aid debugging here, there are some things to be aware of. Debugging is almost always intrusive. Adding debug code can change the situation enough to make the bug seem to disappear. Thus, you should keep debug code to a minimum and make sure it does not show up in production code.\n\n### 14 Scheduling Tasks\n\nThere are two main ways of running tasks: tasklets and work queues. Tasklets are a quick and easy way of scheduling a single function to be run. For example, when triggered from an interrupt, whereas work queues are more complicated but also better suited to running multiple things in a sequence.\n\nIt is possible that in future tasklets may be replaced by threaded irqs. However, discussion about that has been ongoing since 2007 ([Eliminating tasklets](https://lwn.net/Articles/239633)\n), so do not hold your breath. See the section [15.1](#interrupt-handlers1)\n if you wish to avoid the tasklet debate.\n\n#### 14.1 Tasklets\n\nHere is an example tasklet module. The `tasklet_fn` function runs for a few seconds. In the meantime, execution of the `example_tasklet_init` function may continue to the exit point, depending on whether it is interrupted by softirq.\n\n1/\\* \n2\u00a0\\*\u00a0example\\_tasklet.c \n3\u00a0\\*/ \n4#include\u00a0<linux/delay.h> \n5#include\u00a0<linux/interrupt.h> \n6#include\u00a0<linux/module.h> \n7#include\u00a0<linux/printk.h> \n8 \n9/\\*\u00a0Macro\u00a0DECLARE\\_TASKLET\\_OLD\u00a0exists\u00a0for\u00a0compatibility. \n10\u00a0\\*\u00a0See\u00a0https://lwn.net/Articles/830964/ \n11\u00a0\\*/ \n12#ifndef\u00a0DECLARE\\_TASKLET\\_OLD \n13#define\u00a0DECLARE\\_TASKLET\\_OLD(arg1,\u00a0arg2)\u00a0DECLARE\\_TASKLET(arg1,\u00a0arg2,\u00a00L) \n14#endif \n15 \n16static\u00a0void\u00a0tasklet\\_fn(unsigned\u00a0long\u00a0data) \n17{ \n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pr\\_info(\"Example\u00a0tasklet\u00a0starts\\\\n\"); \n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0mdelay(5000); \n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pr\\_info(\"Example\u00a0tasklet\u00a0ends\\\\n\"); \n21} \n22 \n23static\u00a0DECLARE\\_TASKLET\\_OLD(mytask,\u00a0tasklet\\_fn); \n24 \n25static\u00a0int\u00a0\\_\\_init\u00a0example\\_tasklet\\_init(void) \n26{ \n27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pr\\_info(\"tasklet\u00a0example\u00a0init\\\\n\"); \n28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0tasklet\\_schedule(&mytask); \n29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0mdelay(200); \n30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pr\\_info(\"Example\u00a0tasklet\u00a0init\u00a0continues...\\\\n\"); \n31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0return\u00a00; \n32} \n33 \n34static\u00a0void\u00a0\\_\\_exit\u00a0example\\_tasklet\\_exit(void) \n35{ \n36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pr\\_info(\"tasklet\u00a0example\u00a0exit\\\\n\"); \n37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0tasklet\\_kill(&mytask); \n38} \n39 \n40module\\_init(example\\_tasklet\\_init); \n41module\\_exit(example\\_tasklet\\_exit); \n42 \n43MODULE\\_DESCRIPTION(\"Tasklet\u00a0example\"); \n44MODULE\\_LICENSE(\"GPL\");\n\nSo with this example loaded `dmesg` should show:\n\ntasklet\u00a0example\u00a0init\nExample\u00a0tasklet\u00a0starts\nExample\u00a0tasklet\u00a0init\u00a0continues...\nExample\u00a0tasklet\u00a0ends\n\nAlthough tasklet is easy to use, it comes with several drawbacks, and developers are discussing about getting rid of tasklet in linux kernel. The tasklet callback runs in atomic context, inside a software interrupt, meaning that it cannot sleep or access user-space data, so not all work can be done in a tasklet handler. Also, the kernel only allows one instance of any given tasklet to be running at any given time; multiple different tasklet callbacks can run in parallel.\n\nIn recent kernels, tasklets can be replaced by workqueues, timers, or threaded interrupts.[1](#fn1x0)\n While the removal of tasklets remains a longer-term goal, the current kernel contains more than a hundred uses of tasklets. Now developers are proceeding with the API changes and the macro `DECLARE_TASKLET_OLD` exists for compatibility. For further information, see [https://lwn.net/Articles/830964/](https://lwn.net/Articles/830964/)\n.\n\n#### 14.2 Work queues\n\nTo add a task to the scheduler we can use a workqueue. The kernel then uses the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) to execute work within the queue.\n\n1/\\* \n2\u00a0\\*\u00a0sched.c \n3\u00a0\\*/ \n4#include\u00a0<linux/init.h> \n5#include\u00a0<linux/module.h> \n6#include\u00a0<linux/workqueue.h> \n7 \n8static\u00a0struct\u00a0workqueue\\_struct\u00a0\\*queue\u00a0=\u00a0NULL; \n9static\u00a0struct\u00a0work\\_struct\u00a0work; \n10 \n11static\u00a0void\u00a0work\\_handler(struct\u00a0work\\_struct\u00a0\\*data) \n12{ \n13\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pr\\_info(\"work\u00a0handler\u00a0function.\\\\n\"); \n14} \n15 \n16static\u00a0int\u00a0\\_\\_init\u00a0sched\\_init(void) \n17{ \n18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0queue\u00a0=\u00a0alloc\\_workqueue(\"HELLOWORLD\",\u00a0WQ\\_UNBOUND,\u00a01); \n19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0INIT\\_WORK(&work,\u00a0work\\_handler); \n20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0queue\\_work(queue,\u00a0&work); \n21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0return\u00a00; \n22} \n23 \n24static\u00a0void\u00a0\\_\\_exit\u00a0sched\\_exit(void) \n25{ \n26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0destroy\\_workqueue(queue); \n27} \n28 \n29module\\_init(sched\\_init); \n30module\\_exit(sched\\_exit); \n31 \n32MODULE\\_LICENSE(\"GPL\"); \n33MODULE\\_DESCRIPTION(\"Workqueue\u00a0example\");\n\n### 15 Interrupt Handlers\n\n#### 15.1 Interrupt Handlers\n\nExcept for the last chapter, everything we did in the kernel so far we have done as a response to a process asking for it, either by dealing with a special file, sending an `ioctl()` , or issuing a system call. But the job of the kernel is not just to respond to process requests. Another job, which is every bit as important, is to speak to the hardware connected to the machine.\n\nThere are two types of interaction between the CPU and the rest of the computer\u2019s hardware. The first type is when the CPU gives orders to the hardware, the other is when the hardware needs to tell the CPU something. The second, called interrupts, is much harder to implement because it has to be dealt with when convenient for the hardware, not the CPU. Hardware devices typically have a very small amount of RAM, and if you do not read their information when available, it is lost.\n\nUnder Linux, hardware interrupts are called IRQ\u2019s (Interrupt ReQuests). There are two types of IRQ\u2019s, short and long. A short IRQ is one which is expected to take a very short period of time, during which the rest of the machine will be blocked and no other interrupts will be handled. A long IRQ is one which can take longer, and during which other interrupts may occur (but not interrupts from the same device). If at all possible, it is better to declare an interrupt handler to be long.\n\nWhen the CPU receives an interrupt, it stops whatever it is doing (unless it is processing a more important interrupt, in which case it will deal with this one only when the more important one is done), saves certain parameters on the stack and calls the interrupt handler. This means that certain things are not allowed in the interrupt handler itself, because the system is in an unknown state. Linux kernel solves the problem by splitting interrupt handling into two parts. The first part executes right away and masks the interrupt line. Hardware interrupts must be handled quickly, and that is why we need the second part to handle the heavy work deferred from an interrupt handler. Historically, BH (Linux naming for Bottom Halves) statistically book-keeps the deferred functions. Softirq and its higher level abstraction, Tasklet, replace BH since Linux 2.3.\n\nThe way to implement this is to call `request_irq()` to get your interrupt handler called when the relevant IRQ is received.\n\nIn practice IRQ handling can be a bit more complex. Hardware is often designed in a way that chains two interrupt controllers, so that all the IRQs from interrupt controller B are cascaded to a certain IRQ from interrupt controller A. Of course, that requires that the kernel finds out which IRQ it really was afterwards and that adds overhead. Other architectures offer some special, very low overhead, so called \"fast IRQ\" or FIQs. To take advantage of them requires handlers to be written in assembly language, so they do not really fit into the kernel. They can be made to work similar to the others, but after that procedure, they are no longer any faster than \"common\" IRQs. SMP enabled kernels running on systems with more than one processor need to solve another truckload of problems. It is not enough to know if a certain IRQs has happened, it\u2019s also important to know what CPU(s) it was for. People still interested in more details, might want to refer to \"APIC\" now.\n\nThis function receives the IRQ number, the name of the function, flags, a name for /proc/interrupts and a parameter to be passed to the interrupt handler. Usually there is a certain number of IRQs available. How many IRQs there are is hardware-dependent.\n\nThe flags can be used for specify behaviors of the IRQ. For example, use `IRQF_SHARED` to indicate you are willing to share the IRQ with other interrupt handlers (usually because a number of hardware devices sit on the same IRQ); use the `IRQF_ONESHOT` to indicate that the IRQ is not reenabled after the handler finished. It should be noted that in some materials, you may encouter another set of IRQ flags named with the `SA` prefix. For example, the `SA_SHIRQ` and the `SA_INTERRUPT` . Those are the the IRQ flags in the older kernels. They have been removed completely. Today only the `IRQF` flags are in use. This function will only succeed if there is not already a handler on this IRQ, or if you are both willing to share.\n\n#### 15.2 Detecting button presses\n\nMany popular single board computers, such as Raspberry Pi or Beagleboards, have a bunch of GPIO pins. Attaching buttons to those and then having a button press do something is a classic case in which you might need to use interrupts, so that instead of having the CPU waste time and battery power polling for a change in input state, it is better for the input to trigger the CPU to then run a particular handling function.\n\nHere is an example where buttons are connected to GPIO numbers 17 and 18 and an LED is connected to GPIO 4. You can change those numbers to whatever is appropriate for your board.\n\n1/\\* \n2\u00a0\\*\u00a0intrpt.c\u00a0-\u00a0Handling\u00a0GPIO\u00a0with\u00a0interrupts \n3\u00a0\\* \n4\u00a0\\*\u00a0Based\u00a0upon\u00a0the\u00a0RPi\u00a0example\u00a0by\u00a0Stefan\u00a0Wendler\u00a0(devnull@kaltpost.de) \n5\u00a0\\*\u00a0from: \n6\u00a0\\*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0https://github.com/wendlers/rpi-kmod-samples \n7\u00a0\\* \n8\u00a0\\*\u00a0Press\u00a0one\u00a0button\u00a0to\u00a0turn\u00a0on\u00a0a\u00a0LED\u00a0and\u00a0another\u00a0to\u00a0turn\u00a0it\u00a0off. \n9\u00a0\\*/ \n10 \n11#include\u00a0<linux/gpio.h> \n12#include\u00a0<linux/interrupt.h> \n13#include\u00a0<linux/kernel.h>\u00a0/\\*\u00a0for\u00a0ARRAY\\_SIZE()\u00a0\\*/ \n14#include\u00a0<linux/module.h> \n15#include\u00a0<linux/printk.h> \n16 \n17static\u00a0int\u00a0button\\_irqs\\[\\]\u00a0=\u00a0{\u00a0-1,\u00a0-1\u00a0};

A threaded IRQ splits the one handler in `request_irq()` into two: one for the top-half, the other for the bottom-half. The `request_threaded_irq()` is the function for using threaded IRQs. Two handlers are registered at once in the `request_threaded_irq()` .\n\nThose two handlers run in different context. The top-half handler runs in interrupt context. It\u2019s the equivalence of the handler passed to the `request_irq()` . The bottom-half handler on the other hand runs in its own thread. This thread is created on registration of a threaded IRQ. Its sole purpose is to run this bottom-half handler. This is where a threaded IRQ is \u201cthreaded\u201d. If `IRQ_WAKE_THREAD` is returned by the top-half handler, that bottom-half serving thread will wake up. The thread then runs the bottom-half handler.\n\nHere is an example of how to do the same thing as before, with top and bottom halves, but using threads.\n\n1/\\* \n2\u00a0\\*\u00a0bh\\_thread.c\u00a0-\u00a0Top\u00a0and\u00a0bottom\u00a0half\u00a0interrupt\u00a0handling \n3\u00a0\\* \n4\u00a0\\*\u00a0Based\u00a0upon\u00a0the\u00a0RPi\u00a0example\u00a0by\u00a0Stefan\u00a0Wendler\u00a0(devnull@kaltpost.de) \n5\u00a0\\*\u00a0from: \n6\u00a0\\*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0https://github.com/wendlers/rpi-kmod-samples \n7\u00a0\\* \n8\u00a0\\*\u00a0Press\u00a0one\u00a0button\u00a0to\u00a0turn\u00a0on\u00a0a\u00a0LED\u00a0and\u00a0another\u00a0to\u00a0turn\u00a0it\u00a0off \n9\u00a0\\*/ \n10 \n11#include\u00a0<linux/module.h> \n12#include\u00a0<linux/kernel.h> \n13#include\u00a0<linux/gpio.h> \n14#include\u00a0<linux/delay.h> \n15#include\u00a0<linux/interrupt.h> \n16 \n17static\u00a0int\u00a0button\\_irqs\\[\\]\u00a0=\u00a0{\u00a0-1,\u00a0-1\u00a0};

This function only takes one additional parameter than the `request_irq()` \u2013 the bottom-half handling function that runs in its own thread. In this example it is the `button_bottom_half()` . Usage of other parameters are the same as `request_irq()` .\n\nPresence of both handlers is not mandatory. If either of them is not needed, pass the `NULL` instead. A `NULL` top-half handler implies that no action is taken except to wake up the bottom-half serving thread, which runs the bottom-half handler. Similarly, a `NULL` bottom-half handler effectively acts as if `request_irq()` were used. In fact, this is how `request_irq()` is implemented.\n\nNote that passing `NULL` to both handlers is considered an error and will make registration fail.\n\n### 16 Virtual Input Device Driver\n\nThe input device driver is a module that provides a way to communicate with the interaction device via the event. For example, the keyboard can send the press or release event to tell the kernel what we want to do. The input device driver will allocate a new input structure with `input_allocate_device()` and sets up input bitfields, device id, version, etc. After that, registers it by calling `input_register_device()` .\n\nHere is an example, vinput, It is an API to allow easy development of virtual input drivers. The drivers needs to export a `vinput_device()` that contains the virtual device name and `vinput_ops` structure that describes:\n\n*   the init function: `init()`\n*   the input event injection function: `send()`\n*   the readback function: `read()`\n\nThen using `vinput_register_device()` and `vinput_unregister_device()` will add a new device to the list of support virtual input devices.\n\n1int\u00a0init(struct\u00a0vinput\u00a0\\*);\n\nThis function is passed a `struct\u00a0vinput` already initialized with an allocated `struct\u00a0input_dev` . The `init()` function is responsible for initializing the capabilities of the input device and register it.\n\n1int\u00a0send(struct\u00a0vinput\u00a0\\*,\u00a0char\u00a0\\*,\u00a0int);\n\nThis function will receive a user string to interpret and inject the event using the `input_report_XXXX` or `input_event` call. The string is already copied from user.\n\n1int\u00a0read(struct\u00a0vinput\u00a0\\*,\u00a0char\u00a0\\*,\u00a0int);\n\nThis function is used for debugging and should fill the buffer parameter with the last event sent in the virtual input device format. The buffer will then be copied to user.\n\nvinput devices are created and destroyed using sysfs. And, event injection is done through a /dev node. The device name will be used by the userland to export a new virtual input device.\n\nThe `class_attribute` structure is similar to other attribute types we talked about in section [8](#sysfs-interacting-with-your-module)\n:\n\n1struct\u00a0class\\_attribute\u00a0{ \n2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0struct\u00a0attribute\u00a0attr; \n3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ssize\\_t\u00a0(\\*show)(struct\u00a0class\u00a0\\*class,\u00a0struct\u00a0class\\_attribute\u00a0\\*attr, \n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0char\u00a0\\*buf); \n5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ssize\\_t\u00a0(\\*store)(struct\u00a0class\u00a0\\*class,\u00a0struct\u00a0class\\_attribute\u00a0\\*attr, \n6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0const\u00a0char\u00a0\\*buf,\u00a0size\\_t\u00a0count); \n7};\n\nIn vinput.c, the macro `CLASS_ATTR_WO(export/unexport)` defined in [include/linux/device.h](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/include/linux/device.h)\n (in this case, device.h is included in [include/linux/input.h](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/include/linux/input.h)\n) will generate the `class_attribute` structures which are named class\\_attr\\_export/unexport.

If your code contains boolean conditions and if you know that the conditions are almost always likely to evaluate as either `true` or `false` , then you can allow the compiler to optimize for this using the `likely` and `unlikely` macros. For example, when allocating memory you are almost always expecting this to succeed.\n\n1bvl\u00a0=\u00a0bvec\\_alloc(gfp\\_mask,\u00a0nr\\_iovecs,\u00a0&idx); \n2if\u00a0(unlikely(!bvl))\u00a0{ \n3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0mempool\\_free(bio,\u00a0bio\\_pool); \n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0bio\u00a0=\u00a0NULL; \n5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0goto\u00a0out; \n6}\n\nWhen the `unlikely` macro is used, the compiler alters its machine instruction output, so that it continues along the false branch and only jumps if the condition is true. That avoids flushing the processor pipeline. The opposite happens if you use the `likely` macro.\n\n#### 18.2 Static keys\n\nStatic keys allow us to enable or disable kernel code paths based on the runtime state of key. Its APIs have been available since 2010 (most architectures are already supported), use self-modifying code to eliminate the overhead of cache and branch prediction. The most typical use case of static keys is for performance-sensitive kernel code, such as tracepoints, context switching, networking, etc. These hot paths of the kernel often contain branches and can be optimized easily using this technique. Before we can use static keys in the kernel, we need to make sure that gcc supports `asm\u00a0goto` inline assembly, and the following kernel configurations are set:\n\n1CONFIG\\_JUMP\\_LABEL=y \n2CONFIG\\_HAVE\\_ARCH\\_JUMP\\_LABEL=y \n3CONFIG\\_HAVE\\_ARCH\\_JUMP\\_LABEL\\_RELATIVE=y\n\nTo declare a static key, we need to define a global variable using the `DEFINE_STATIC_KEY_FALSE` or `DEFINE_STATIC_KEY_TRUE` macro defined in [include/linux/jump\\_label.h](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/include/linux/jump_label.h)\n. This macro initializes the key with the given initial value, which is either false or true, respectively. For example, to declare a static key with an initial value of false, we can use the following code:\n\n1DEFINE\\_STATIC\\_KEY\\_FALSE(fkey);\n\nOnce the static key has been declared, we need to add branching code to the module that uses the static key. For example, the code includes a fastpath, where a no-op instruction will be generated at compile time as the key is initialized to false and the branch is unlikely to be taken.\n\n1pr\\_info(\"fastpath\u00a01\\\\n\");

In a kernel module, you can only use kernel functions which are the functions you can see in /proc/kallsyms.\n\n#### 19.2 Disabling interrupts\n\nYou might need to do this for a short time and that is OK, but if you do not enable them afterwards, your system will be stuck and you will have to power it off.\n\n### 20 Where To Go From Here?\n\nFor those deeply interested in kernel programming, [kernelnewbies.org](https://kernelnewbies.org)\n and the [Documentation](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/Documentation)\n subdirectory within the kernel source code are highly recommended. Although the latter may not always be straightforward, it serves as a valuable initial step for further exploration. Echoing Linus Torvalds\u2019 perspective, the most effective method to understand the kernel is through personal examination of the source code.\n\nContributions to this guide are welcome, especially if there are any significant inaccuracies identified. To contribute or report an issue, please initiate an issue at [https://github.com/sysprog21/lkmpg](https://github.com/sysprog21/lkmpg)\n. Pull requests are greatly appreciated.\n\nHappy hacking!\n\n[1](#fn1x0-bk)\nThe goal of threaded interrupts is to push more of the work to separate threads, so that the minimum needed for acknowledging an interrupt is reduced, and therefore the time spent handling the interrupt (where it can\u2019t handle any other interrupts at the same time) is reduced.

In a prepared kernel build system (i.e; all build dependencies and cross-compile tools installed) build the kernel image. I do this in an unprivileged systemd-nspawn amd64 container to avoid messy -dev package installs on the host. Nspawn bind-mounts the host&#x27;s source-code tree which includes a separate build directory:<p><pre><code>  cd &quot;${SRC_DIR}&quot;\n  # copy&#x2F;install&#x2F;configure a suitable ${BUILD_DIR}&#x2F;.config; review&#x2F;edit with:\n  make V=1 ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- O=${BUILD_DIR} -j 4 menuconfig\n  # build the kernel\n  export KBUILD_BUILD_USER=linux; export KBUILD_BUILD_HOST=iam.tj; time make V=1 LOCALVERSION=&quot;&quot; ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- O=${BUILD_DIR} -j 12 Image\n  # build gdb helper (Python) scripts \n  export KBUILD_BUILD_USER=linux; export KBUILD_BUILD_HOST=iam.tj; time make V=1 LOCALVERSION=&quot;&quot; ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- O=${BUILD_DIR} scripts_gdb\n</code></pre>\nThis will create the debug symbols needed by gdb in ${BUILD_DIR}&#x2F;vmlinux and the executable kernel in ${BUILD_DIR}&#x2F;arch&#x2F;arm64&#x2F;boot&#x2F;Image<p>2. Install &quot;gdb&quot; (and if doing foreign architecture debugging &quot;gdb-multiarch&quot;) on the host as well as &quot;qemu-system-arm&quot;<p>3. Execute the kernel but -S[uspend] it and have QEMU listen for a connection from gdb:<p><pre><code>  qemu-system-aarch64 -machine virt,gic-version=3 -cpu max,pauth-impdef=on -smp 2 -m 4096 -nographic -kernel ${BUILD_DIR}&#x2F;arch&#x2F;arm64&#x2F;boot&#x2F;Image -append &quot;debug $( for l in {144..157}; do echo -n param$l=$(pwgen $((l-9)) 1)&#x27; &#x27;; done )&quot; -initrd rootfs&#x2F;boot&#x2F;initrd.img-6.8.12-arm64-debug -S -gdb tcp::1234\n</code></pre>\nThe -append and -initrd shown here are optional; in my case no -initrd is actually needed since the (silent) panic occurs in the first few instructions the kernel executes. If debugging loadable modules however they would be in the initrd and loaded in the usual way. If the problem being diagnosed occurs after the root file-system and userspace proper are active then one would need to add the appropriate qemu options for the emulated storage device where the root file-system lives.<p>4. In another terminal shell (I use &quot;tmux&quot; and create a new tmux window) start the debugger:<p><pre><code>  cd ${BUILD_DIR}\n  # this cd is important - gdb needs to be in the base of the BUILD directory\n  gdb-multiarch .&#x2F;vmlinux\n</code></pre>\n5. In the gdb shell:<p><pre><code>  target remote :1234\n  break __parse_cmdline\n  continue\n</code></pre>\nAt this point the usual gdb functionality is available to examine memory, variables, single-step, view the stack and so on.<p>For more details on debugging kernel using gdb and the gdb scripts lx-* see<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kernel.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;html&#x2F;latest&#x2F;dev-tools&#x2F;gdb-kernel-debugging.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kernel.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;html&#x2F;latest&#x2F;dev-tools&#x2F;gdb-kernel-...</a><p>Edit: Forgot to note that for gdb to be able to use the lx-* Python scripts it usually needs the path authorising:<p><pre><code>  echo &quot;add-auto-load-safe-path ${SRC_DIR}&#x2F;scripts&#x2F;gdb&#x2F;vmlinux-gdb.py&quot; &gt; ~&#x2F;.gdbinit</code></pre>\n- **ototot** (): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35782630\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35782630</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28283030\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28283030</a>\n- **simonz05** (): See also The Linux Memory Manager: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linuxmemory.org&#x2F;chapters\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linuxmemory.org&#x2F;chapters</a> Last update the author sent out was in early July noting that the book is now in editing:<p>&gt; I am happy to report that I have completed the first draft of the book [...]\n&gt; I am now in an editing phase, which may well take some time.

Robert ([robg](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=robg)\n) reached out and we began discussing his work in the neural basis of semantic knowledge and how he built social semantic algorithms way back in 2008. Despite the intervening 16 years, we're amazed that social networks, even Hacker News, don't compute and display the trusted voices across topics. Instead of prioritizing pages based on content, social networks could prioritize the people behind the content. The semantic map of the community, in effect, breaks down to computable regions based on the ways people use language to talk about their knowledge and interests.\n\nIn short, why is it so hard to discover and explore the people who best know about different topics, the extent of their knowledge, and how they relate to like minds? So Robert and I have been jamming for the last month toward some examples based on the semantics of Hacker News. For every user, based on their HN comments, I've computed their place in the complete semantic map of the entire community.\n\nYou can explore and interact with the new app at [hn2.wilsonl.in](https://hn2.wilsonl.in)\n.\n\nHere are some cool things we discovered as we've looked at how to expand the Hackerverse:\n\n*   We can **organize your semantics** on Hacker News. By starting with a user for the semantics of the community we show your contributions to HN semantically alongside similar users, and your \"unique identity\" of words you use.\n    \n    *   For example, check out [robg's new profile](https://hn2.wilsonl.in/user/robg)\n        .\n*   We can **search** the semantics of HN based on who knows what. The n-th order semantics shows how any search vector decomposes into the constituent people and how they use language in the community. Example queries:\n    \n    *   [startups](https://hn2.wilsonl.in/search/startups)\n        \n    *   [go vs rust programming](https://hn2.wilsonl.in/search/go%20vs%20rust%20programming)\n        \n    *   [neuroscience and sleep](https://hn2.wilsonl.in/search/neuroscience%20and%20sleep)\n        \n    *   [email marketing](https://hn2.wilsonl.in/search/email%20marketing)\n        \n*   We can **map the community** by who knows what and their relationships based on the semantics involved. Knowledge is not equally uniform, so this topography of the community helps to highlight the people and what they know.\n    \n\nWhen you add up these three capabilities\u2014organize your semantics, search the semantics, and map the community\u2014we think the technology starts to show the people behind the words. Rather than organizing the world's information, what if we could organize the world's people? It has us thinking about a whole range of social knowledge challenges, but we'd love to hear your thoughts. Please join the waitlist if you'd like to further explore with us as we make more progress on this project. We're focused on the fun of finding and connecting with people not pages, and we'd love to hear your thoughts.\n\n-----\nGenerate comments in a hierarchical structure with 3 comments per level, up to a depth of 3."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n- **wonger_** (): Personally, I like how HN focuses on content and discussions rather than individual users.

It\u2019s being sold as a new suite of features for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac that will use artificial intelligence to help you write and edit emails, create new pictures and emojis, and generally accomplish all kinds of tasks. There\u2019s just one problem if you\u2019re a European user eager to get your hands on it: Apple won\u2019t be releasing it in Europe.\n\nIn June, Apple announced a new product called [Apple Intelligence](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/introducing-apple-intelligence-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/)\n. It\u2019s being sold as a new suite of features for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac that will use artificial intelligence to help you write and edit emails, create new pictures and emojis, and generally accomplish all kinds of tasks. There\u2019s just one problem if you\u2019re a European user eager to get your hands on it: Apple won\u2019t be releasing it in Europe.\n\nThe company said in a statement that an entire suite of new products and features including Apple Intelligence, SharePlay screen sharing, and iPhone screen mirroring [would not be released](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/21/apple-ai-europe-dma-macos.html)\n in European Union countries because of the regulatory requirements imposed by the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA). European Commission Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager [called the decision](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2510200/eu-commissioner-slams-apple-intelligence-delay.html)\n a \u201cstunning declaration\u201d of anti-competitive behavior.\n\nVestager\u2019s statement is ridiculous on its face: A tech giant choosing not to release a product invites more competition, not less, and more importantly, this is exactly what you\u2019d expect to happen given Europe\u2019s regulatory stance.\n\nThe economist Albert Hirschman once [described](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674276604)\n the two options in an unfavorable environment as \u201cvoice\u201d and \u201cexit.\u201d The most common option is voice\u2014attempt to negotiate, repair the situation, and communicate toward better conditions. But the more drastic option is exit\u2014choosing to leave the unfavorable environment entirely. That\u2019s more common for people or political movements, but it\u2019s growing increasingly relevant to technology in Europe.\n\nApple\u2019s decision isn\u2019t the first time that poorly designed regulations have pushed tech companies to block features or services in specific countries. Last year, Facebook [removed all news content](https://www.voanews.com/a/facebook-news-ban-in-canada-leaves-small-outlets-struggling-/7489564.html)\n in Canada in response to the country\u2019s Online News Act, which resulted in smaller news outlets losing business. In 2014, Google News [withdrew from Spain](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/11/google-news-spain-to-close-in-response-to-tax-on-story-links)\n over a \u201clink tax,\u201d causing [lower traffic](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2837553)\n for Spanish news sites, returning only when the law was changed. Numerous technology firms have left China due to the power the Chinese Communist Party exerts over foreign corporations.\n\nAdult sites are blocking users in a [variety of U.S. states](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2024/03/18/pornhub-blocks-states-with-new-age-verification-laws-is-florida-next/73014384007/)\n over age verification laws. Meta delayed the EU rollout of its Twitter (now X) competitor Threads over regulatory concerns, though it did eventually [launch there](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67695643)\n. The firm, in a move that mirrors the Apple Intelligence decision, has also [declined to release its cutting-edge Llama AI models](https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/18/24201041/meta-multimodal-llama-ai-model-launch-eu-regulations)\n in the EU, citing \u201cregulatory uncertainty.\u201d Technology companies have traditionally invested large amounts of money in voice strategies, lobbying officials and trying to improve poorly written laws. But they are increasingly aware of their ability to exit, especially in the European context. And Europe\u2019s regulatory approach risks creating a balkanized \u201csplinternet,\u201d where international tech giants may choose to withdraw from the European continent.\n\nIf that seems far-fetched, consider other recent cases. Europe recently charged Meta with [breaching EU regulations](https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-charged-with-failing-comply-with-eu-tech-rules-2024-07-01/)\n over its \u201cpay or consent\u201d plan. Meta\u2019s business is built around personalized ads, which are worth far more than non-personalized ads. EU regulators required that Meta provide an option that did not involve tracking user data, so Meta created a paid model that would allow users to pay a fee for an ad-free service.\n\nThis was already a significant concession\u2014personalized ads are so valuable that one analyst estimated paid users would bring in [60 percent less revenue](https://mobiledevmemo.com/metas-next-tactic-in-the-eu-pay-or-okay/)\n. But EU regulators are now insisting this model also breaches the rules, saying that Meta fails to provide a less personalized but equivalent version of Meta\u2019s social networks. They\u2019re demanding that Meta provide free full services without personalized ads or a monthly fee for users. In a very real sense, the EU has ruled that Meta\u2019s core business model is illegal. Non-personalized ads cannot economically sustain Meta\u2019s services, but it\u2019s the only solution EU regulators want to accept.\n\nOr consider the recent charges the EU levied against X. Under Elon Musk\u2019s ownership, anyone can now purchase a blue check with a paid subscription, whereas blue checks were previously reserved for notable figures. EU regulators singled out the new system for blue checks as a [deceptive business practice](https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2024/0712/1459534-musk-x-brussels/)\n that violates the bloc\u2019s Digital Services Act.\n\nThese charges are absurd. For one, the change in the blue check system was widely advertised and dominated [headlines](https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/11/4/23438917/twitter-verifications-blue-check-elon-musk)\n for months\u2014as well as dominating discussion on the site itself. The idea that users have been deceived by one of the loudest and most discussed product changes in the site\u2019s history is silly. And beyond that, the EU\u2019s position is essentially \u201cX cannot change the meaning of the blue check feature\u2014it is permanently bound to the EU\u2019s interpretation of what a blue check should mean.\u201d This goes far beyond competition or privacy concerns; this is the EU straightforwardly making product decisions on behalf of a company.\n\nA final example comes from France, where regulators are preparing to charge Nvidia with [anti-competitive practices](https://www.reuters.com/technology/french-antitrust-regulators-preparing-nvidia-charges-sources-say-2024-07-01/)\n related to its [CUDA software](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-cuda-2/)\n. CUDA is a free software system developed by Nvidia to run on its chips that allows other programs to more efficiently utilize GPUs in calculations. It\u2019s one of the main reasons Nvidia has been so successful\u2014the software makes its chips more powerful, and no competitor has developed comparable technology. It\u2019s exactly the kind of innovative research that should be rewarded, but French regulators seem to view Nvidia\u2019s decades-long investment in CUDA as a crime.\n\nRead More\n\n[![Tusk, Macron, and Scholz meet in Berlin](https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/tusk-macron-scholz-weimar-GettyImages-2086258104-e1721380765365.jpg?w=800?quality=80)](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/07/19/europe-eu-strategy-leadership-france-germany-poland-security-russia/)\n\nTusk, Macron, and Scholz meet in Berlin\n\n[### Who Will Fill Europe\u2019s Leadership Vacuum?](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/07/19/europe-eu-strategy-leadership-france-germany-poland-security-russia/)\n\nParis is cheap and Berlin has no strategy. For serious leadership, look to Warsaw.\n\n[Argument](https://foreignpolicy.com/category/analysis/argument/)\n\n|\n\n[Bart M. J. Szewczyk](https://foreignpolicy.com/author/bart-m-j-szewczyk/)\n\nThese examples all share a few key features. They\u2019re all actions aimed at successful foreign tech companies\u2014not surprising since the EU\u2019s rules all but ensure there are [no comparably successful European companies](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/10/23/metaverse-europe-uk-us-big-tech-regulation-innovation/)\n. They\u2019re all instances of regulatory overreach, where the EU is trying to dictate product decisions or rule entire business strategies illegal. And crucially, the sizes of the possible fines in play are so large that they may end up scaring companies off the continent.\n\nEU policy allows for fines of up to [10 percent of global revenue](https://competition-policy.ec.europa.eu/index/fines_en)\n. Analyst Ben Thompson [reports](https://stratechery.com/2024/the-e-u-goes-too-far/)\n that Meta only gets 10 percent of its revenue from the EU and Apple only 7 percent. Nvidia does not provide exact regional numbers, but it\u2019s [likely](https://en.macromicro.me/charts/81141/nvda-revenue-region-us-tw-cn)\n that the EU provides less than 10 percent of its revenue as well. And this is revenue, not profit. A single fine of that magnitude would be more profit than these companies make in the EU in several years and destroy the economic rationale for operating there. With global-sized punishments for inane local issues, Europe is much closer than it realizes to simply driving tech companies away.\n\nEurope\u2019s regulators may insist that if companies simply followed the rules, they\u2019d be able to make their profits without the threat of fines. This is patently untrue in the case of Meta, where the EU has ruled out every practical business strategy for funding its operations. But it\u2019s also impossible writ large because the EU often doesn\u2019t write clear rules in advance. Instead, the DMA requires businesses to meet abstract goals, and regulators decide afterward [whether the company is in compliance or not](https://cepa.org/article/demystifying-europes-digital-markets-act/)\n. The burden does not exist on the EU to write concrete rules with specific requirements but on the companies to read the regulatory tea leaves and determine what steps to take. It\u2019s an arbitrary and poorly designed system, and companies can hardly be blamed for looking to the exit.\n\nUltimately, Europe needs to figure out what it wants from the world\u2019s technology industry. At times, it seems as if Europe has given up on trying to innovate or succeed in the tech sector. The continent takes more pride in being a leader in regulation than a leader in innovation, and its tech industry is a rounding error compared with that in the United States or China.\n\nWhat few success stories it has, such as France\u2019s Mistral, risk being strangled by regulatory actions. How would Mistral, a leading AI firm, survive if Nvidia exits the French market due to regulatory concerns? There is no substitute for Nvidia\u2019s cutting-edge chips.\n\nEuropeans could end up living in an online backwater with out-of-date phones, cut off from the rest of the world\u2019s search engines and social media sites, unable to even access high-performance computer chips.\n\nAs a sovereign body, the EU is within its rights to legislate tech as arbitrarily and harshly as it would like. But politicians such as Vestager don\u2019t get to then act shocked and outraged when tech companies choose to leave. Right now, most tech companies are still attempting to work within the system and make Europe\u2019s regulations more rational. But if voice fails over and over, exit is all that\u2019s left. And in Europe, it\u2019s an increasingly rational choice.\n\n*    Economics\n*    Science and Technology\n\n**Jeremiah Johnson** is the cofounder of the Center for New Liberalism and writes at Infinite Scroll.\n\nRead More On |\n\n[View Comments](javascript:void(0);)\n\n[View Comments](javascript:void(0);)\n\n**You are commenting as .** [Change your username](javascript:void(0);)\n | [Log out](javascript:void(0);)\n\n### Change your username:\n\nUsername \n\n I agree to abide by FP\u2019s [comment guidelines](https://foreignpolicy.com/comment-guidelines)\n.

Why? because either a company before tried to monopolise the entire country, or they killed someone.<p>Now, large tech companies haven&#x27;t wholesale killed people (unlike say tobacco, or talc powder, 3M and half of their solvents, weed killer, most car makers, etc etc)<p>but they have been trying desperately to stop all competition.<p>They&#x27;ve also been trying to extract as much personal info as possible for profit. Because regulators in the USA are hamstrung, they are used to being able to basically doing stuff that would be illegal if it were in physical stores&#x2F;pre-existing industries.\n  - **pembrook** (): Nobody is against regulation that disfavors large incumbents to support competition instead.<p>You&#x27;ll struggle to find people who are against the Digital Markets Act for this reason. It literally only targets the potential monopolists.<p>However, virtually every other piece of regulation does the opposite.<p>Regulation usually gets trotted out after the downside of doing [new innovation] is experienced. This always happens, because doing something new always involves unknown risk. Most people aren&#x27;t entrepreneurs and hate risk, so they pass regulation, and the market gets locked down so nothing new happens again. Incumbents and their army of lawyers can easily comply or are grandfathered in, and challengers are permanently disadvantaged. That market is officially dead until the next fundamental leap forward in technology.<p>What&#x27;s different now though, is the hysteria over AI is leading regulators to pass this incumbent-cementing regulation <i>before we&#x27;ve even had a chance to experience both the upside and downside,</i> so the innovation never happens at all.<p>Combine this with a rapidly aging demography in Europe, and I only see this trend increasing. If there&#x27;s one thing old people hate, it&#x27;s risk and doing new things. Meanwhile, those same old folks are expecting massive payouts (social benefits) via taxation of the same private sector they&#x27;re currently kneecapping with red tape. While ironic, those two trends converging aren&#x27;t great for Europe.\n    - **no_wizard** (): Specifically with AI I don\u2019t want to experience the downside of innovation before we regulate because of how wide spread its use already is, and it\u2019s problems have already become apparent.<p>For example, it\u2019s being used to job screen applicants even though we have proven that AI models still suffer from thing like racial bias. Companies don\u2019t disclose how their models are trained to negate bias or anything like that either and that\u2019s one example I remember off the top of my head\n    - **swatcoder** (): &gt; What&#x27;s different now though, is the hysteria over AI is leading regulators to pass potential market killing regulation<p>This is <i>entirely</i> because the experts and fundraisers <i>in the field</i> promoted the technology as existentially and societally dangerous before they even got it to do anything commercially viable. &quot;This has so much potential that it could destroy us all!&quot; was the sales pitch!<p>Of course regulators are going to take that seriously, as there&#x27;s nobody of influence vested in trying to show them otherwise.\n    - **harimau777** (): &gt;&gt; Most people aren&#x27;t entrepreneurs and hate risk, so they pass regulation, and the market gets locked down so nothing new happens again<p>I think that the bigger issue is that the people who suffer when the risk goes bad and the people who benefit when the risk goes well usually aren&#x27;t the same people.\n  - **kube-system** (): The move-fast-and-break-things mentality of many tech companies has absolutely killed people.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abcnews.go.com&#x2F;GMA&#x2F;Family&#x2F;parents-kids-died-after-drugs-snapchat-speak-ahead&#x2F;story?id=104040833\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abcnews.go.com&#x2F;GMA&#x2F;Family&#x2F;parents-kids-died-after-dr...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;10&#x2F;01&#x2F;business&#x2F;instagram-suicide-ruling-britain.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;10&#x2F;01&#x2F;business&#x2F;instagram-suicid...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbsnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;electric-scooter-electric-bike-accidents-rise-last-four-years&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbsnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;electric-scooter-electric-bike-...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;family-sues-airbnb-19-month-old-dies-fentanyl-toxicity-florida-vacatio-rcna73536\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;family-sues-airbnb-19-m...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;tech-news&#x2F;rohingya-seek-reparations-facebook-role-massacre-rcna49956\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;tech-news&#x2F;rohingya-seek-reparat...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedrive.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;40234&#x2F;no-one-was-driving-in-tesla-autopilot-crash-that-killed-two-in-texas-police\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedrive.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;40234&#x2F;no-one-was-driving-in-te...</a><p>&quot;full-self-driving doesn&#x27;t self drive&quot;, &quot;wear a helmet on the bird scooter&quot;, and &quot;safety is our first priority at facebook&quot; is the 21st century version of &quot;don&#x27;t get roundup all over yourself&quot;\n    - **xvector** (): This is the cost of progress. There will never (ever) be a a major new technological shift that does not kill people. No matter what you do, no matter how hard you try, you will <i>never</i> stop someone from dying because of some new major technology.<p>You might, however, kill far more people in the process of delaying progress that could have ultimately culminated in them having been saved.\n    - **edmundsauto** (): The hard part about reality is the opposite is also true.

It just won&#x27;t have one that includes Apple products which refuse to follow the law. Seems like a massive win for the EU, and because Apple is the one deciding to pull their products rather than follow the law they can&#x27;t really complain either, so win&#x2F;win I guess.\n  - **cheptsov** (): Except EU doesn\u2019t have big tech.\n    - **dijit** (): Anything that gets close gets bought or killed by non-european giants.<p>Tencent buys basically all game companies, microsoft buys basically all communication companies (skype, nokia come to mind), google buys basically everything.

(a clear similarity I saw after being in BMW R&amp;D and Googles Zurich and SF campuses)\n    - **okanat** (): EU didn&#x27;t go into an uncontrolled spree investing every company that had .com in its name and ruined thousands of lives and wasted billions of dollars.<p>EU usually doesn&#x27;t let companies to grow uncontrollable sizes that the government is completely controlled by them not the citizens.<p>The existence of Big Tech means that the government did a very poor job in protecting the consumers and the free and fair market\n    - **autoexec** (): Not on Apple&#x27;s scale, but with apple pulling products from the market, this opens the door for someone else to step up and fill that highly profitable gap in the market apple abandoned. I really hope that they do. The more players there are in the game from other countries the better off we&#x27;ll all be.\n  - **AceJohnny2** (): &gt; <i>The EU is free to pass laws preventing gatekeepers</i><p>I&#x27;m intentionally taking this out of context to point out that laws <i>can act as gatekeepers</i> and help preserve incumbent&#x27;s positions.<p>Stuff like &quot;minimum service requirement&quot; which require new entrants to front a massive initial investment, preventing them from getting a foothold (see: France telecom landscape in the 90s-&#x27;10s). GDPR was crafted by the likes of Google &amp; Meta that were strong enough to weather the transition, but kill off smaller competition.<p>There are always tradeoffs, but those aren&#x27;t talked about as much.\n    - **autoexec** (): It&#x27;s absolutely true that regulations can be written by corporations to keep out competitors. Regulations are just tools. They can be used to protect and benefit the majority or to further enrich a small number of wealthy and powerful individuals. I haven&#x27;t seen anything to convince me that the Digital Markets Act was written to hurt competition at the expense of the public.\n  - **amelius** (): Yeah if people complain about government regulation then they&#x27;ve never seen a company regulate a market.\n"}]}

In this post I\u2019m going to walk through one of my favorite algorithms, the median-of-medians approach to find the median of a list in deterministic linear time. Although proving that this algorithm runs in linear time is a bit tricky, this post is targeted at readers with only a basic level of algorithmic analysis.\n\n### Finding the median in O(n log n)\n\nThe most straightforward way to find the median is to sort the list and just pick the median by its index. The fastest comparison-based sort is `\\(O(n \\log n)\\)`, so that dominates the runtime.[1](#fn:2)\n[2](#fn:3)\n\n    def nlogn_median(l):\n        l = sorted(l)\n        if len(l) % 2 == 1:\n            return l[len(l) / 2]\n        else:\n            return 0.5 * (l[len(l) / 2 - 1] + l[len(l) / 2])\n\nAlthough this method offers the simplest code, it\u2019s certainly not the fastest.\n\n### Finding the median in average O(n)\n\nOur next step will be to _usually_ find the median within linear time, assuming we don\u2019t get unlucky. This algorithm, called \u201cquickselect\u201d, was devevloped by Tony Hoare who also invented the similarly-named quicksort. It\u2019s a recursive algorithm that can find any element (not just the median).\n\n1.  Pick an index in the list. It doesn\u2019t matter how you pick it, but choosing one at random works well in practice. The element at this index is called the **pivot**.\n2.  Split the list into 2 groups:\n    1.  Elements less than or equal to the pivot, `lesser_els`\n    2.  Elements strictly greater than the pivot, `great_els`\n3.  We know that one of these groups contains the median. Suppose we\u2019re looking for the _kth_ element:\n    *   If there are _k_ or more elements in `lesser_els`, recurse on list `lesser_els`, searching for the _kth_ element.\n    *   If there are fewer than _k_ elements in `lesser_els`, recurse on list `greater_els`. Instead of searching for _k_, we search for `k-len(lesser_els)`.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of the algorithm running on a list with 11 elements:\n\n    Consider the list below. We'd like to find the median.\n    l = [9,1,0,2,3,4,6,8,7,10,5]\n    len(l) == 11, so we're looking for the 6th smallest element\n    First, we must pick a pivot. We randomly select index 3.\n    The value at this index is 2.\n    \n    Partitioning based on the pivot:\n    [1,0,2], [9,3,4,6,8,7,10,5]\n    We want the 6th element. 6-len(left) = 3, so we want\n    the third smallest element in the right array\n    \n    We're now looking for third smallest element in the array below:\n    [9,3,4,6,8,7,10,5]\n    We pick an index at random to be our pivot.\n    We pick index 3, the value at which, l[3]=6\n    \n    Partitioning based on the pivot:\n    [3,4,5,6] [9,7,10]\n    We want the 3rd smallest element, so we know it's the\n    3rd smallest element in the left array\n    \n    We're now looking for the 3rd smallest in the array below:\n    [3,4,5,6]\n    We pick an index at random to be our pivot.\n    We pick index 1, the value at which, l[1]=4\n    Partitioning based on the pivot:\n    [3,4] [5,6]\n    We're looking for the item at index 3, so we know it's\n    the smallest in the right array.\n    \n    We're now looking for the smallest element in the array below:\n    [5,6]\n    \n    At this point, we can have a base case that chooses the larger\n    or smaller item based on the index.\n    We're looking for the smallest item, which is 5.\n    return 5\n    \n\nTo find the median with quickselect, we\u2019ll extract quickselect as a separate function. Our `quickselect_median` function will call `quickselect` with the correct indices.\n\n    import random\n    def quickselect_median(l, pivot_fn=random.choice):\n        if len(l) % 2 == 1:\n            return quickselect(l, len(l) // 2, pivot_fn)\n        else:\n            return 0.5 * (quickselect(l, len(l) / 2 - 1, pivot_fn) +\n                          quickselect(l, len(l) / 2, pivot_fn))\n    \n    \n    def quickselect(l, k, pivot_fn):\n        \"\"\"\n        Select the kth element in l (0 based)\n        :param l: List of numerics\n        :param k: Index\n        :param pivot_fn: Function to choose a pivot, defaults to random.choice\n        :return: The kth element of l\n        \"\"\"\n        if len(l) == 1:\n            assert k == 0\n            return l[0]\n    \n        pivot = pivot_fn(l)\n    \n        lows = [el for el in l if el < pivot]\n        highs = [el for el in l if el > pivot]\n        pivots = [el for el in l if el == pivot]\n    \n        if k < len(lows):\n            return quickselect(lows, k, pivot_fn)\n        elif k < len(lows) + len(pivots):\n            # We got lucky and guessed the median\n            return pivots[0]\n        else:\n            return quickselect(highs, k - len(lows) - len(pivots), pivot_fn)\n\nQuickselect excels in the real world: It has almost no overhead and operates in average `\\(O(n)\\)`. Let\u2019s prove it.\n\n#### Proof of Average O(n)\n\nOn average, the pivot will split the list into 2 approximately equal-sized pieces. Therefore, each subsequent recursion operates on 1\u20442 the data of the previous step.\n\n$$C=n+\\\\frac{n}{2}+\\\\frac{n}{4}+\\\\frac{n}{8}+\u2026=2n=O(n)$$\n\nThere are many ways to prove that this series converges to 2n. Rather than reproducing one here, I\u2019ll just direct you to the excellent [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1/2_%2B_1/4_%2B_1/8_%2B_1/16_%2B_%E2%8B%AF)\n about this specific infinite series.\n\nQuickselect gets us linear performance, but only in the average case. What if we aren\u2019t happy to be average, but instead want to guarantee that our algorithm is linear time, no matter what?\n\n### Deterministic O(n)\n\nIn the section above, I described quickselect, an algorithm with _average_ `\\(O(n)\\)` performance. Average in this context means that, _on average_, the algorithm will run in `\\(O(n)\\)`. Technically, you could get extremely unlucky: at each step, you could pick the largest element as your pivot. Each step would only remove one element from the list and you\u2019d actually have `\\(O(n^2)\\)` performance instead of `\\(O(n)\\)`.\n\nWith that in mind, what follows is an algorithm for _picking pivots_. Our goal will be to pick a pivot in linear time that removes enough elements in the worst case to provide `\\(O(n)\\)` performance when used with quickselect. This algorithm was originally developed in 1973 by the mouthful of Blum, Floyd, Pratt, Rivest, and Tarjan. If my treatment is unsatisfying, their [1973 paper](http://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/BFPRT73.pdf)\n will certainly be sufficient. Rather than walk through the algorithm in prose, I\u2019ve heavily annotated my Python implementation below:\n\n    def pick_pivot(l):\n        \"\"\"\n        Pick a good pivot within l, a list of numbers\n        This algorithm runs in O(n) time.\n        \"\"\"\n        assert len(l) > 0\n    \n        # If there are < 5 items, just return the median\n        if len(l) < 5:\n            # In this case, we fall back on the first median function we wrote.\n            # Since we only run this on a list of 5 or fewer items, it doesn't\n            # depend on the length of the input and can be considered constant\n            # time.\n            return nlogn_median(l)\n    \n        # First, we'll split `l` into groups of 5 items. O(n)\n        chunks = chunked(l, 5)\n    \n        # For simplicity, we can drop any chunks that aren't full. O(n)\n        full_chunks = [chunk for chunk in chunks if len(chunk) == 5]\n    \n    \n        # Next, we sort each chunk. Each group is a fixed length, so each sort\n        # takes constant time. Since we have n/5 chunks, this operation\n        # is also O(n)\n        sorted_groups = [sorted(chunk) for chunk in full_chunks]\n    \n        # The median of each chunk is at index 2\n        medians = [chunk[2] for chunk in sorted_groups]\n    \n        # It's a bit circular, but I'm about to prove that finding\n        # the median of a list can be done in provably O(n).\n        # Finding the median of a list of length n/5 is a subproblem of size n/5\n        # and this recursive call will be accounted for in our analysis.\n        # We pass pick_pivot, our current function, as the pivot builder to\n        # quickselect. O(n)\n        median_of_medians = quickselect_median(medians, pick_pivot)\n        return median_of_medians\n    \n    def chunked(l, chunk_size):\n        \"\"\"Split list `l` it to chunks of `chunk_size` elements.\"\"\"\n        return [l[i:i + chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(l), chunk_size)]\n\nLet\u2019s prove why the median-of-medians is a good pivot. To help, consider this visualization of our pivot-selection algorithm:\n\n![Pivot selection visualization](https://rcoh.me/images/median-of-medians.svg)\n\nThe red oval denotes the medians of the chunks, and the center circle denotes the median-of-medians. Recall that we want our pivot to split the list as evenly as possible. Let\u2019s consider the worst possible case \u2013 the case where are pivot is as close as possible to the beginning of the list (without loss of generality, this argument symmetrically applies to the end of the list as well.)\n\nConsider the four quadrants (which overlap, including the center column (when the number of columns is odd) & middle row):\n\n*   Top left: Every item in this quadrant is strictly less than the median\n*   Bottom left: These items may be bigger (or smaller!) than the median\n*   Top right: These items may be bigger (or smaller!) than the median\n*   Bottom right: Every item in this quadrant is strictly greater than the median\n\nOut of these four two quadrants are useful because they allow us to make assertions about their contents (top left, bottom right) and two are not (bottom left, top right).\n\nNow lets return to our original task, finding the worst possible case where our pivot falls as early in the list as possible. As I argued above, at a minimum, every item in the top left is strictly less than our pivot. How many items are there as a function of `\\(n\\)`? Each column has 5 items, of which we\u2019ll take 3; we\u2019re taking half of the columns, thus:\n\n$$f(n)=\\\\frac{3}{5}\\*\\\\frac{1}{2}n=\\\\frac{3}{10}n$$\n\nTherefore, at each step, at minimum, we will remove, at minimum, 30% of the rows.\n\nBut is dropping 30% of the elements at each step sufficient? It\u2019s worse than the 50% we achieved in the randomized algorithm. At each step, our algorithm must do:\n\n*   O(n) work to partition the elements\n*   Solve 1 subproblem 1\u20445 the size of the original to compute the median of medians\n*   Solve 1 subproblem 7\u204410 the size of the original as the recursive step\n\nThis yields the following equation for the total runtime, `\\(T(n)\\)`:\n\n$$T(n)=n + T\\\\left(\\\\frac{n}{5}\\\\right)+T\\\\left(\\\\frac{7n}{10}\\\\right)$$\n\nIt\u2019s not straightforward to prove why this is `\\(O(n)\\)`. The initial version of this post alluded to the master theorem, but someone recently brought to my attention that that is incorrect \u2013 since there are two recursive terms, you can\u2019t apply the master theorem. Rather, the only straightforward proof that I\u2019m aware of is by induction.[3](#fn:induction)\n\n### Recap\n\nWe have quickselect, an algorithm that can find the median in linear time given a sufficiently good pivot. We have our median-of-medians algorithm, an `\\(O(n)\\)` algorithm to select a pivot (which is good enough for quickselect). Combining the two, we have an algorithm to find the median (or the nth element of a list) in linear time!\n\n### Linear Time Medians In Practice\n\nIn the real world, selecting a pivot at random is almost always sufficient. Although the median-of-medians approach is still linear time, it just takes too long to compute in practice. The `C++` standard library uses an algorithm called [introselect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introselect)\n which utilizes a combination of heapselect and quickselect and has an `\\(O(n \\log n)\\)` bound. Introselect allows you to use a generally fast algorithm with a poor upper bound in combination with an algorithm that is slower in practice but has a good upper bound. Implementations start with the fast algorithm, but fall back to the slower algorithm if they\u2019re unable to pick effective pivots.\n\nTo finish out, here\u2019s a comparison of the elements considered by each implementation. This isn\u2019t runtime performance, but instead the total number of elements looked at by the quickselect function. It doesn\u2019t count the work to compute the median-of-medians. The point of this graph **is not** to demonstrate that median-of-medians is a good algorithm, but rather to demonstrate that it\u2019s an effective way to pick pivots.\n\n![Graph of elements visited](https://rcoh.me/images/medians-graph.png)\n\nIt\u2019s exactly what you would expect! The deterministic pivot almost always considers fewer elements in quickselect than the random pivot. Sometimes we get lucky and guess the pivot on the first try, which manifests itself as dips in the green line. Math works!\n\nP.S: In 2017 a [new paper](http://erdani.com/research/sea2017.pdf)\n came out that actually makes the median-of-medians approach competitive with other selection algorithms.

Reddit users `axjv` and `linkazoid` pointed out that `9` mysteriously disappeared in my example which has since been fixed. Another astute reader pointed out several errors which have since been resolved:\n\n*   The recurrence relation was `\\(7T(n/10)\\)` but should have been `\\(T(7n/10))\\)`\n*   The master theorem is actually inapplicable in this case\n*   I incorrectly referred to the top right, instead of top left quadrant in my arguments\n\n* * *\n\nWant to get emailed about new blog posts?\n\nI post about once every few weeks on topics like [databases](/tags/databases)\n, [language internals](/tags/language-internals)\n and [algorithms](/tags/algorithms)\n, and recently, [deep learning](/tags/deep-learning)\n.\n\n* * *\n\nDo you want to hire me?

MapReduce was what we were using for processing large amounts of data at the time. With MapReduce over that much data, you don&#x27;t just want linear time, but ideally single pass, distributed across machines. Subsequent passes over much smaller amounts of data are fine.<p>It was a struggle until I figured out that knowledge of the precision and range of our data helped. These were timings, expressed in integer milliseconds. So they were non-negative, and I knew the 90th percentile was well under a second.<p>As the article mentions, finding a median typically involves something akin to sorting. With the above knowledge, bucket sort becomes available, with a slight tweak in my case. Even if the samples were floating point, the same approach could be used as long as an integer (or even fixed point) approximation that is very close to the true median is good enough, again assuming a known, relatively small range.<p>The idea is to build a dictionary where the keys are the timings in integer milliseconds and the values are a count of the keys&#x27; appearance in the data, i.e., a histogram of timings. The maximum timing isn&#x27;t known, so to ensure the size of the dictionary doesn&#x27;t get out of control, use the knowledge that the 90th percentile is well under a second and count everything over, say, 999ms in the 999ms bin. Then the dictionary will be limited to 2000 integers (keys in the range 0-999 and corresponding values) - this is the part that is different from an ordinary bucket sort. All of that is trivial to do in a single pass, even when distributed with MapReduce. Then it&#x27;s easy to get the median from that dictionary &#x2F; histogram.\n  - **justinpombrio** (): Did you actually need to find the true median of billions of values? Or would finding a value between 49.9% and 50.1% suffice? Because the latter is much easier: sample 10,000 elements uniformly at random and take their median.<p>(I made the number 10,000 up, but you could do some statistics to figure out how many samples would be needed for a given level of confidence, and I don&#x27;t think it would be prohibitively large.)\n    - **rented_mule** (): The kind of margin you indicate would have been plenty for our use cases. But, we were already processing all these log entries for multiple other purposes in a single pass (not one pass per thing computed). With this single pass approach, the median calculation could happen with the same single-pass parsing of the logs (they were JSON and that parsing was most of our cost), roughly for free.<p>Uniform sampling also wasn&#x27;t obviously simple, at least to me. There were thousands of log files involved, coming from hundreds of computers. Any single log file only had timings from a single computer. What kind of bias would be introduced by different approaches to distributing those log files to a cluster for the median calculation? Once the solution outlined in the previous comment was identified, that seemed simpler that trying to understand if we were talking about 49-51% or 40-50%. And if it was too big a margin, restructuring our infra to allow different log file distribution algorithms would have been far more complicated.\n    - **enriquto** (): &gt; the latter is much easier: sample 10,000 elements uniformly at random and take their median<p>Do you have a source for that claim?<p>I don&#x27;t see how could that possibly be true... For example, if your original points are sampled from two gaussians of centers -100 and 100, of small but slightly different variance, then the true median can be anywhere between  the two centers, and you may need a humungous number of samples to get anywhere close to it.<p>True, in that case any point between say -90 and 90 would be equally good as a median in most applications.  But this does not mean that the median can be found accurately by your method.\n    - **hhmc** (): You also can use the fact that for any distribution, the median is never further than 1SD away from the mean.\n  - **digaozao** (): I am not sure. But from the outside, it looks like what Prometheus does behind the scenes.\nIt seems to me that Prometheus works like that because it has a limit on latency time around 10s on some systems I worked.\nSo when we had requests above that limit it got all on 10s, even though it could be higher than that.\nInteresting.\n  - **Filligree** (): Was this by any chance for generating availability metrics, and were you an intern at the time? The system sounds, ah, very familiar.\n    - **rented_mule** (): The metrics were about speed. And I was decades past my last internship at the time in question. But, as is so often the case, more than one of us may have been reinventing pretty similar wheels. :)\n- **xinok** (): &gt; P.S: In 2017 a new paper came out that actually makes the median-of-medians approach competitive with other selection algorithms.

I\u2019m now conceptually more into [Dungeon World](https://dungeon-world.com/)\n\u2019s approach, but I digress.\n\nUnlike Tom Hanks, I avoided turning into a [delusional murderer](https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/tom-hanks-film-debut-was-a-drama-about-dungeons-dragons/)\n. Instead, I deepened some friendships, had a lot of big laughs, learned some cool vocabulary, and had an indirect introduction to systems design. Importantly, I also annoyed the hell out of my high school principal.\n\nIf you are not familiar with Dungeons & Dragons, there are two general flavors for how to play:\n\n1.  Using miniatures and a map, or\n2.  Theater of the mind.\n\nWe elected for theater of the mind more often than not. This was mostly because the rule books by themselves were expensive enough, and my friends and I were lower middle class.\n\nTheater of the mind play means that the entire game is conducted verbally. The sole exception is your character sheet, which is a text and number-based armature you build the rest of your character from.\n\nThe narrative is shared amongst everyone by talking. The aesthetics of the game exist entirely in each player\u2019s mind, and not communicated via moving little figures around on a map.\n\nYou can probably guess where this post is going now.\n\nThank you, random Dragon Magazine issue\n---------------------------------------\n\nBecause I cannot [half-ass](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/half-ass)\n anything, I went hard on immersing myself in the culture surrounding Dungeons and Dragons. This included subscribing to [Dragon magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_(magazine))\n.\n\nI don\u2019t remember the issue number, or the original author. However, I do remember it was from an advice column. The problem was the person who was running the game wanting to enliven his descriptions, as they felt like their narration was both boring and confusing.\n\nThe advice for that problem was spectacular, and it boiled down to **describing the most important thing first**.\n\nConsider:\n\n> A large room with rough stone walls. Brownish moss clings to the walls, and trickles of brackish water also flow down parts of it. Broken furniture is scattered across on the floor. The ceiling is so high that you cannot see it. Also, there is a large red dragon attacking you.\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019d want to know about the red dragon\u2019s presence and activity a lot more than the quality of the masonry. There\u2019s also another odd bit of putting too much detail on the wrong thing.\n\nLet\u2019s rephrase it:\n\n> A huge dragon the color of a smoldering coal is attacking you! It is rearing its snake-like neck up to strike, head poised underneath a ceiling that is so high you cannot see it. Its dull black, iron-like claws dig into the floor of the rough stone room as it prepares to lunge at you. Broken furniture is scattered about, no doubt victims of previous altercations.\n\nWe\u2019ve put the most important thing first. We then **supply detail in an order that aids in understanding the main point**, and discard information that is irrelevant to the overall concept we\u2019re trying to communicate and mood we\u2019re trying to evoke.\n\nWe now know:\n\n1.  There\u2019s a big dragon, and it\u2019s seriously pissed off,\n2.  There\u2019s ample room for it to move around,\n3.  It can, and has previously made good on its threats, and that\n4.  There\u2019s not a lot of places to take cover.\n\nThis is explicit prioritization of information. It also demonstrates that informative information can also be entertaining.\n\nContext, context, context\n-------------------------\n\nObservant readers may also note I\u2019ve added some emotion with the exclamation point, as well as adding some more flowery language into the mix.\n\nAlternative text descriptions ([alt text](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/alt)\n) are as much an art as much as they are a science.\n\nA red dragon attack is **a significant event**, so additional detail and emotion helps. I feel confident in both editorializing the experience as well as punching it up, given that the larger goal is to communicate a frenetic, action-packed encounter.\n\nThe same also applies in reverse. **Smaller, more succinct descriptions can be equally helpful** in situations where the content is not a major contributor of the overall thing you\u2019re trying to communicate.\n\nIn Dungeons & Dragons this is a bit of an in-joke. Over-describing something trivial can lead to your players fixating on it, completely derailing the plot as they try and uncover the secrets behind something mundane that you had no pre-formulated plans for.\n\nThis is why you want to go with this:\n\n> A worn, wooden mug full of cheap ale.\n\nOver this:\n\n> A stout mug crafted from reclaimed lumber. It is poorly stained and worn smooth from years of heavy use. Twin iron bands are placed at the top and bottom, equally as worn and giving it a comfortable heft. A thin, frothy ale has been poured into it, smelling weakly of hops and strongly of alcohol. A single rivulet of ale pours down the side of the mug to stain the bar top the mug is placed on.\n\nI mean, it\u2019s a great description, but also not the point. The point is you\u2019re in a seedy pub chasing down rumors about a goblin who somehow got its grubby little hands on a powerful magic artifact.\n\nFor alt text, we want to also consider the larger context of **what you\u2019re trying to communicate**, **why**, and **if the detail you provide helps that effort to communicate**.\n\nConsider the difference between a small badge that indicates a product has been recently-added to the storefront:\n\n> New!\n\nAnd [this Tweet from NASA](https://x.com/NASA/status/1552750698114187269)\n showcasing a photo from the James Webb telescope:\n\n> A dramatic blade made of red gaseous wisps comes down top-to-bottom in the center of the image as smaller green wisps feather out in horizontal directions. A bright star shrouded in blue light is near the center of the bow-like blade. Blue dots in different sizes dot the background of the image, signifying neighboring stars.\u2063\n\nTone and mood\n-------------\n\nThese two concepts are the bread and butter of a roleplaying game experience. Consider:\n\n> The vizier prattles on, clearly in love with the sound of their own voice. Meanwhile, the rest of the court slumps\u2014bored, exasperated, and succumbing to the stifling heat of the high summer. They are taking their cue from the sultan, some nakedly jealous of the cushioned throne he is slowly nodding off on.\n> \n> In the desperation of scanning the room to find something more interesting to look at, you catch the unblinking gaze of the court jester. His stare makes you feel like a butterfly pinned to a specimen spreading board. The room begins to slowly fade to black as you continue to lock eyes. A subtle foxfire aura begins to shimmer around his frame, while a placeless humming sound gets louder and louder. The heat of the room is forgotten as a chill runs down your spine.\n\nOr:\n\n> A white woman with short blue hair smirks at the camera and raises a glass to it. Her drink is a margarita, and the glass is beaded with sweat from the heat of the day. She is wearing a loose white shirt, and oversized red sunglasses are perched perfectly on her head. Her hair is slightly frizzy from the humidity, but her expression clearly communicates that she is unbothered by it. It is the golden hour, and the sun casts a warm, hazy amber glow on her skin. The table she is sitting at is wooden and well-worn. Behind her is a busy street, a blur of people going about their day.\n\nBoth of these descriptions are **evocative**.\n\nAs the author of both experiences I am trying to not only:\n\n1.  Describe what is physically present, but also\n2.  How all the qualities add up as a suggestion for how to feel when taken in as a composite whole.\n\nFor the roleplaying game description, I am injecting an immediate sense of fear and menace into an otherwise boring situation. For the image description, I am I am creating a sense of relaxation and contentment.\n\nAdditionally, the introduction of the vizier may seem contradictory when compared to the dragon on a first read through. Remember that this is **an editorialized experience**.\n\nThe most important thing in this scene is the feelings of shock and fear when something unexpected and unsettling interrupts the mundane. In order to create that feeling, we need to first establish the humdrum experience of an boring, endless meeting in a stifling room.\n\nThe user experience of assistive technology\n-------------------------------------------\n\nAnother reason why I advocate for describing the most important thing first is because of how screen readers announce alt text. A screen reader will read it in a linear order, starting from the first word in the string and ending with the last.\n\nUnlike other web content, there isn\u2019t really any other special way screen readers can work with alt text strings\u2014short of increasing or decreasing the speaking rate. This is also why things like bolding, italicizing, links, and paragraphs aren\u2019t allowed.\n\nAnother important thing to know about screen readers is that they have dedicated keyboard commands to make them [pause or stop announcing](https://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvda/documentation/userGuide.html#StartingAndStoppingNVDA)\n. There are a few use cases for this behavior, but the most common one is, \u201cYup, I got it. Shut up now.\u201d\n\nPlacing helpful, but ultimately non-critical information after the most important thing **lets the person using the screen reader decide when they know enough to get what they need**. It also saves them from wasting time re-listening to superfluous information if re-navigating to the image to glean some important detail (\u201cOh, what was the subject of that painting again?\u201d).\n\nRemember, you control the narrative\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe person who runs the game of Dungeons & Dragons has a responsibility to provide an entertaining and memorable experience for the other participants.\n\n**You wield power as the person enabling and facilitating the experiences others have**. This applies to roleplaying games as well as writing alt text.\n\nThis is why I believe [most contemporary images on the web are not decorative](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/06/img-alt-attribute-alternate-description-decorative/)\n. It\u2019s also why I think it\u2019s important to [include details like race, gender, and ethnicity](https://tink.uk/thoughts-on-skin-tone-and-text-descriptions.md-notes-on-synthetic-speech/)\n.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge this fact. For roleplaying games, it [centers around **consent**](https://startplaying.games/blog/posts/tabletop-consent-guide-cj-mccullough)\n. For alt text, it centers around **autonomy**.\n\nWe want to ensure that people who cannot see the image have [the capability to understand it the same way as someone who can](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/images.html#general-guidelines)\n. There is a huge amount of power in this act.\n\nSkills you can cultivate\n------------------------\n\nA decent amount of people are uncomfortable the first time they play a roleplaying game. Acting out a character in front of others can feel strange at first, but is also a feeling that passes the more you do it.\n\nThe same applies for writing alt text. The more often you practice it, the better you get at it.\n\nThe grim reality is [the state of alt text on the web leaves a lot to be desired](https://webaim.org/projects/million/#alttext)\n. That said, writing it can be a joy and an art.

As correctly noted by the author, describing by importance first has the added benefit of allowing screen reader users to skip irrelevant&#x2F;uninteresting images early.<p>Compare:<p>Torn-up painting in a gallery, observers standing in front of the work.<p>vs.<p>Gallery interior, people standing in front of a painting with visible damage.\n  - **the_other** (): &gt; Most people intuitively describe images from foreground to background or left to right<p>I&#x27;ve heard there are cultural biases to this ordering. Some cultures tend to describe the background or scene first. The example I read about identified Japan as an &quot;outside in&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve been encouraging my kid to use &quot;outside in&quot; or &quot;context first&quot; in their descriptions with me, mainly because they suck at giving context. I doubt I&#x27;d have known about it if I hadn&#x27;t read that about Japan.<p>Would love to hear from a Japanese person on this.\n    - **LorenPechtel** (): I can&#x27;t speak from a Japanese perspective, but there&#x27;s definitely a specific-to-general or general-to-specific nature to languages.<p>&quot;If you can get it in the next 60 seconds there&#x27;s a million dollars in the jar in the back right of the second shelf of refrigerator.&quot;  My wife is Chinese, she works from a general-to-specific worldview and I would be surprised if she could follow those directions in the time limit.<p>Flip it and say &quot;If you can get to it in the next 60 seconds there&#x27;s a million dollars in the refrigerator, on the second shelf, in the back right, in a jar.&quot;  and she would have no problem with it.<p>We focus on the specific, build up the image of it&#x27;s environment and then paste it into the world.  She refines the world so all the references are left hanging until the whole sentence is complete and that&#x27;s probably enough to confuse her.  We just find her approach to feel odd but we can still follow it much better than she can follow ours.\n  - **rcarr** (): I think of this in cinematic terms. The first sentence is going to start with a shot of the painting, then it will either cut, zoom or dolly out to reveal the crowd. Whereas the second shot starts with the wide angle of the gallery and then does the opposite. Each has a slightly different effect on the scene and the audience.\n  - **lelanthran** (): &gt; As correctly noted by the author, describing by importance first has the added benefit of allowing screen reader users to skip irrelevant&#x2F;uninteresting images<p>Good rule of thumb, but also <i>very</i> context dependent. Consider the following example of a pattern used extensively by Douglas Adams, and a little by Terry Pratchett, in service of humour:<p><pre><code>    I made my escape by swiftly sliding down the laundry chute, my fall\n    being gently broken by the Wednesday rota for large duvets. A perfect\n    plan to avoid spraining the other ankle.\n\n    Too bad today was Thursday.\n\n</code></pre>\nFor a dungeon crawler:<p><pre><code>    You breathlessly take in the wonder of the large underground\n    cavern; the twinkling of glow-worms high above resembling\n    the night sky, the luminous ore-lines tracing sinuous veins\n    away into the horizon, the mountains in the distance, at once\n    both masking and highlighting just how large the cavern is.\n\n    By comparison, the rapidly approaching 300-foot high fire-\n    breathing Dragon intent on devouring your party fatally appears\n    unimpressively small.\n\n</code></pre>\nI can keep this up all day, actually.<p>The point being, punchlines have to go last.\n    - **nazka** (): Yes I actually liked the dragon being last. It created the sense of surprise over a calm unimpressive  room. First the area was described as much as it would be if it was in real life and you were entering the room and scanning it with your eyes until your eyes finally go to this dangerous thing you didn\u2019t see at first.<p>I think it\u2019s better for narrative but for communication for sure the most important things come first, and sometimes last only if you want them to continue to have it in their mind.\n- **vonnik** (): I grew up next to, and a couple years younger than, someone who is now a famous novelist and singer-songwriter. In our childhood, he was renowned in the neighborhood as a dungeon master. He rode the theater of the mind as far is it would take him.<p>The advice in the magazine reminds me of the inverted pyramid structure of classic reporting. Most important first, assume that the reader could stop reading after any sentence, so make the most of each phrase.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Inverted_pyramid_(journalism)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Inverted_pyramid_(journalism...</a>\n  - **looping8** (): I think they are the same thing, the magazine just put it in fun language so the reader would be more interested.<p>This structure is why I don&#x27;t like those ridiculous interviews where it starts with &quot;the actor sits in his home with [long description of furniture], wearing [long description of clothes], he sips coffee from a [long description of mug]&quot;. I just want the interview, I understand that the actor is living somewhere and wearing something, it does not matter.\n    - **orojackson** (): &gt; This structure is why I don&#x27;t like those ridiculous interviews where it starts with &quot;the actor sits in his home with [long description of furniture], wearing [long description of clothes], he sips coffee from a [long description of mug]&quot;. I just want the interview, I understand that the actor is living somewhere and wearing something, it does not matter.<p>While I agree with you that I find this style of writing commonly found in the entertainment section of a weekend piece to be very grating, I would argue that this still follows the bottom line up front. For the audience that these pieces are geared towards, the important part is whether the actor passes the vibe check or not. The latter part of the interview itself is not too important because it is mainly promoting whatever the actor wants to promote in the piece.<p>For instance, &quot;the actor sits in his home with [long description of furniture]&quot; describes how they keep their home&#x27;s interior stylistically. What the actor wears shows how good their fashion sense is. Sipping coffee from a fancy mug shows how wealthy they are and&#x2F;or shows the morning vibe they would exude on a good day.\n    - **vonnik** (): That&#x27;s true. The interesting thing is how D&amp;D creates branching trees of inverted periods, scene by scene and character by character.<p>In great fiction, IMO, there&#x27;s usually something big that you are not certain of yet that makes it propulsive. Sometimes it&#x27;s &quot;which hard choice will the character make in a given scene?&quot; D&amp;D offloads that decision to the players.<p>With journalism and I guess alt text, you have one big inverted pyramid, and then a recipe for sentence structure that attempts to pack all the relevant facts in for each node. It&#x27;s actually trying to front-load how it eliminates the unknowns.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Five_Ws\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Five_Ws</a>\n    - **sharkjacobs** (): Why are you reading a lifestyle interview with &lt;entertainment celebrity&gt; if you don&#x27;t care about their life and how they live? What content in this interview do you care about?\n  - **deleted** (): \n  - **Obscurity4340** (): Like an abstract\n- **jonathanlydall** (): This is actually important for <i>all</i> professional communication (maybe with an exception of marketing), if you want the best chance of getting what you want from the person you&#x27;re communicating with, get to the point within the very first sentence, even if it&#x27;s just a high-level summary, you then have the person&#x27;s complete attention and can elaborate further.<p>If you don&#x27;t get to the point quickly, people might think it doesn&#x27;t really apply&#x2F;matter to them and ignore it.<p>This became very obvious to me when my day job for a few years was responding to customer service requests over email for World of Warcraft. I would often find myself skimming all the useless (quite literally) pretext as quickly as possible scanning for what their <i>actual</i> problem was.<p>Stereotypical example of a poor email from a customer:<p>&gt; Last night I finished the raid with my guild where we downed the Lich King. Then this morning I went to school where my friends and I also talked about WoW, then when I got home, everything seemed normal, I turned on my computer, logged on and entered my password, but it didn&#x27;t work, then I went to the website and used the password reset, then I tried to log on and it said my account was locked, then I checked my email, and it said my account is locked and I need to contact Blizzard...<p>At which point I stop reading and I&#x27;m thinking &quot;<i>finally</i>, I see why he&#x27;s emailing us&quot;.<p>To be fair, these emails are often from adolescents who understandingly do not yet have the experience to do effective communication (which is actually an additional interesting aspect of customer service for a computer game compared to services which are only taken up by adults, but I digress).<p>I now work as a software developer for a startup and often have to interact directly with clients, and when I communicate with them, I <i>always</i> make sure to have my desired &quot;call to action&quot; (even if only summarised) within the first sentence.\n  - **seanhunter** (): Absolutely. I once did a &quot;how to communicate effectively for executives&quot; course and the guy who ran it said his advice for anyone from a scientific&#x2F;technical background was to write the long thoughtful email explaining everything. Cut and paste the last paragraph with your conclusion to the top. Make any minor changes in wording you need. Add (preferably within the first 2 sentences) any action you want the person to take or something saying you don&#x27;t expect them to do anything you&#x27;re just telling them some information you think they will find useful and (hopefully) why.<p>His point was that technical people tend to want to produce an argument with all the information etc and then get to the conclusion. Business people typically will read the first paragraph and sigh because they don&#x27;t know what the email is expecting them to do[1]. Then they go on to doing something else and tell themselves they&#x27;ll come back to it when they have time.<p>[1] Especially not knowing whether the email is just for general information or there is a specific action the recipient needs to take.\n    - **jonathanlydall** (): &gt; technical people tend to want to produce an argument with all the information etc<p>Yes, I was thinking after my comment I should bring this up too, you\u2019ve said it possibly better than I would have.\n  - **joe_the_user** (): Just a quibble,<p>In a business situation, with a motivated person, state the action you want quickly and then give whatever needed details.<p>In a business situation, with an unmotivated person, state the problem quickly and then the action needed for solution (or the reason this is the needed action and then the action, etc).<p>In a story telling situation, you can draw out the scene setting &#x27;till when you state the problem until the final result is suitably dramatic (&quot;For just a second, the mist parts and the rust-red scaly snout of a red dragon can be&quot;)<p>That why I can&#x27;t get the author&#x27;s idea D&amp;D helps with business questions. As a DM, I describe the environment neutrally and don&#x27;t give my players action bullet points &#x27;cause it&#x27;s their job to come up with those (and if I do their job for them, they lose out).\n    - **LorenPechtel** (): I think his point is a priority-first ordering, rather than either a general-to-specific or a specific-to-general ordering.  Most people do one of the latter two.\n  - **HansardExpert** (): &gt; At which point I stop reading and I&#x27;m thinking &quot;finally, I see why he&#x27;s emailing us&quot;.<p>I never like to discourage &#x27;too much&#x27; information because frankly &#x27;end users&#x27; don&#x27;t know what they need to tell us in support (that is kind of what our job is right?). I&#x27;d much prefer the above than just &#x27;it won&#x27;t let me log in&#x27; - where there maybe context that I&#x27;d want.<p>I spend more time asking follow up questions (without being able to provide even a modicum of solution) in many cases, I try to couch my &#x27;questions answering questions&#x27; reply with why I am asking (more typing and explaining) when users don&#x27;t give me chapter and verse, even if it is mostly &#x27;puff&#x27;.<p>&gt; I now work as a software developer for a startup and often have to interact directly with clients, and when I communicate with them, I always make sure have my desired &quot;call to action&quot; (even if only summarised) within the first sentence.<p>But that is <i>after</i> they have emailed you right? You cannot summarize anything until you actually have them tell you what is wrong, no matter how long takes them. So yes summarize in the first sentence is always useful and if you don&#x27;t kow the solution (yet) it never hurts to admit that and say something like, &#x27;but we can try X or see what Y is doing as that will help me understand the issue in more detail&#x27; etc.<p>Customer Support is hard work sometimes, now try doing it with someone who doesn&#x27;t speak your language very well ;)\n    - **bluGill** (): The problem is all too often users have no clue what is useful information. Mechanics hear a lot about the color of the car making a funny noise, but nothing about where the  noise seems to come from or when it is heard, nor do they get told when the last time the transmission oil was changed even though that might be a useful clue.\n    - **jonathanlydall** (): &gt; I never like to discourage &#x27;too much&#x27; information because frankly &#x27;end users&#x27; don&#x27;t know what they need to tell us in support (that is kind of what our job is right?). I&#x27;d much prefer the above than just &#x27;it won&#x27;t let me log in&#x27; - where there maybe context that I&#x27;d want.<p>I agree that more information is sometimes better, but elaborate only <i>after</i> stating the core issue. For example, if you&#x27;re emailing a provider about being overbilled. Start your email with &quot;I&#x27;m writing to you because I have been overbilled and would please like this addressed&quot;, <i>then</i> you lay out your case with all the facts that you think could be relevant. But don&#x27;t start with a whole bunch of facts because the service agent won&#x27;t yet be in the correct context to know which facts are relevant until after they know what problem you&#x27;re trying to have solved.<p>&gt; But that is after they have emailed you right? You cannot summarize anything until you actually have them tell you what is wrong, no matter how long takes them. So yes summarize in the first sentence is always useful and if you don&#x27;t kow the solution (yet) it never hurts to admit that and say something like, &#x27;but we can try X or see what Y is doing as that will help me understand the issue in more detail&#x27; etc.<p>Sorry, I wasn&#x27;t entirely clear, but for this part I was not referring to responses to customer service requests, but more for proactive reach outs initiated from our side towards trying to ensure customer retention and (at the moment) we&#x27;re more of a B2B product so we feel this is worth doing.<p>As &quot;random&quot; reach outs by a supplier are not always appreciated, we always try to offer something of value&#x2F;relevance when doing so, with the first sentence being something like &quot;Hi &lt;person name&gt;, We&#x27;ve recently done &lt;something to our product which we feel is relevant to you&gt;, I was wanting to check if this would be useful to you?&quot;. I can then perhaps elaborate further on the potentially useful thing to them and also close by stating that I would be happy to do a video call to go through it in more detail if they would like.<p>What&#x27;s particularly noteworthy here is that I did a &quot;call to action&quot; which would be low effort on their part, namely to &quot;please at least reply to let me know if this is useful&quot; in the very first sentence. This is actually a bit of a psychological trick where because the recipient has been directly asked to do something in particular, they&#x27;re more likely to continue reading towards doing this and engage.<p>Once we started it on our side, I also started to notice that I see this trick very often to my own inbox from completely cold contact direct marketers, their first sentence often ends with something to the effect of &quot;would &lt;time and date&gt; work for you for us to discuss further?&quot;, I don&#x27;t engage with these completely cold contacts, but I see exactly what they&#x27;re trying to do.\n"}]}

Windows provides a range of operating modes that customers can choose from. This includes the ability to limit what can run to only approved software and drivers. This can increase security and reliability by making Windows operate in a mode closer to mobile phones or appliances.\n2.  Customers can choose integrated security monitoring and detection capabilities that are included with Windows. Or they can choose to replace or supplement this security with a wide variety of choices from a vibrant open ecosystem of vendors.\n\nIn this blog post, we examine the recent CrowdStrike outage and provide a technical overview of the root cause. We also explain why security products use kernel-mode drivers today and the safety measures Windows provides for third-party solutions. In addition, we share how customers and security vendors can better leverage the integrated security capabilities of Windows for increased security and reliability. Lastly, we provide a look into how Windows will enhance extensibility for future security products.\n\nCrowdStrike recently published a [Preliminary Post Incident Review](https://www.crowdstrike.com/falcon-content-update-remediation-and-guidance-hub/)\n analyzing their outage. In their blog post, CrowdStrike describes the root cause as a memory safety issue\u2014specifically a read out-of-bounds access violation in the CSagent driver. We leverage the Microsoft [WinDBG Kernel Debugger](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debugger-download-tools)\n and [several extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debuggercmds/-reg)\n that are available free to anyone to perform this analysis.

This is often used by security products to scan any new file saved to disk, such as downloading a file via the browser.\n\nFile System filters can also be used as a signal for security solutions attempting to monitor the behavior of the system. CrowdStrike noted in their blog that part of their content update was changing the sensor\u2019s logic relating to data around named pipe creation. The File System filter driver API allows the driver to receive a call when named pipe activity (e.g., named pipe creation) occurs on the system that could enable the detection of malicious behavior. The general function of the driver correlates to the information shared by CrowdStrike.\n\n`6: kd>!reg querykey

\\REGISTRY\\MACHINE\\system\\Controlset001\\control\\earlylaunch`\n\nAs we can see from the above analysis, CrowdStrike loads four driver modules. One of those modules receives dynamic control and content updates frequently based on the CrowdStrike Preliminary Post-incident-review timeline.\n\nWe can leverage the unique stack and attributes of this crash to identify the Windows crash reports generated by this specific CrowdStrike programming error. It\u2019s worth noting the number of devices which generated crash reports is a subset of the number of impacted devices previously shared by [Microsoft in our blog post](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/07/20/helping-our-customers-through-the-crowdstrike-outage/)\n, because crash reports are sampled and collected only from customers who choose to upload their crashes to Microsoft. Customers who [choose to enable crash dump sharing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/privacy/configure-windows-diagnostic-data-in-your-organization)\n help both driver vendors and Microsoft to identify and remediate quality issues and crashes.\n\n![](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Picture1-3.webp)\n\nFigure 1 CrowdStrike driver associated crash dump reports over time\n\nWe make this information available to driver owners so they can assess their own reliability via the [Hardware Dev Center analytics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/dashboard/hardware-program-register)\n dashboard. As we can see from the above, any reliability problem like this invalid memory access issue can lead to widespread availability issues when not combined with safe deployment practices. Let\u2019s dig into why security solutions leverage kernel drivers on Windows.\n\nWhy do security solutions leverage kernel drivers?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nMany security vendors such as CrowdStrike and Microsoft leverage a kernel driver architecture and there are several reasons for this.\n\n### Visibility and enforcement of security related events\n\nKernel drivers allow for system wide visibility, and the capability to load in early boot to detect threats like [boot kits and root kits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/malware/rootkits-malware)\n which can load before user-mode applications. In addition, Microsoft provides a rich set of capabilities such as system event callbacks for process and thread creation and filter drivers which can watch for events like file creation, deletion, or modification. Kernel activity can also trigger call backs for drivers to decide when to block activities like file or process creations. Many vendors also use drivers to collect a variety of network information in the kernel using the [NDIS driver class](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/network/ndis-drivers)\n.\n\n### Performance\n\nKernel drivers are often utilized by security vendors for potential performance benefits. For example, analysis or data collection for high throughput network activity may benefit from a kernel driver. There are many scenarios where data collection and analysis can be optimized for operation outside of kernel mode and Microsoft continues to partner with the ecosystem to improve performance and provide best practices to achieve parity outside of kernel mode.\n\n### Tamper resistance\n\nA second benefit of loading into kernel mode is tamper resistance. Security products want to ensure that their software cannot be disabled by malware, targeted attacks, or malicious insiders, even when those attackers have admin-level privileges. They also want to ensure that their drivers load as early as possible so that they can observe system events at the earliest possible time. Windows provides a mechanism to launch drivers marked as [Early Launch Antimalware](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/early-launch-antimalware)\n (ELAM) early in the boot process for this reason. CrowdStrike signs the above CSboot driver as ELAM, enabling it to load early in the boot sequence.\n\nIn the general case, there is a tradeoff that security vendors must rationalize when it comes to kernel drivers. Kernel drivers provide the above properties at the cost of resilience. Since kernel drivers run at the most trusted level of Windows, where containment and recovery capabilities are by nature constrained, security vendors must carefully balance needs like visibility and tamper resistance with the risk of operating within kernel mode.\n\nAll code operating at kernel level requires extensive validation because it cannot fail and restart like a normal user application. This is universal across all operating systems. Internally at Microsoft, we have invested in moving complex Windows core services from kernel to user mode, such as font file parsing from [kernel to user mode](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-baselines/dropping-the-quot-untrusted-font-blocking-quot-setting/ba-p/701068)\n.\n\nIt is possible today for security tools to balance security and reliability. For example, security vendors can use minimal sensors that run in kernel mode for data collection and enforcement limiting exposure to availability issues. The remainder of the key product functionality includes managing updates, parsing content, and other operations can occur isolated within user mode where recoverability is possible. This demonstrates the best practice of minimizing kernel usage while still maintaining a robust security posture and strong visibility.\n\n![](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Picture2-2.webp)\n\nFigure 2 Example security product architecture which balances security and reliability\n\nWindows provides several user mode protection approaches for anti-tampering, like Virtualization-based security [(VBS) Enclaves](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/trusted-execution/vbs-enclaves)\n and [Protected Processes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/early-launch-antimalware)\n that vendors can use to protect their key security processes. Windows also provides [ETW events](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/new-security-capabilities-in-event-tracing-for-windows/ba-p/3949941)\n and user-mode interfaces like [Antimalware Scan Interface](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/amsi/antimalware-scan-interface-portal)\n for event visibility. These robust mechanisms can be used to reduce the amount of kernel code needed to create a security solution, which balances security and robustness.\n\nHow does Windows help ensure the quality of security related third-party products?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMicrosoft engages with third-party security vendors through an industry forum called the [Microsoft Virus Initiative](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/virus-initiative-criteria)\n (MVI). This group consists of Microsoft and Security Industry and was created to establish a dialogue and collaboration across the Windows security ecosystem to improve robustness in the way security products use the platform. With MVI, Microsoft and vendors collaborate on the Windows platform to define reliable extension points and platform improvements, as well as share information about how to best protect our customers.\n\nMicrosoft works with members of MVI to ensure compatibility with Windows updates, improve performance, and address reliability issues. MVI partners actively participating in the program contribute to making the ecosystem more resilient and gain benefits including technical briefings, feedback loops with Microsoft product teams, and access to antimalware platform features such as ELAM and Protected Processes. Microsoft also provides runtime protection such as [Patch Guard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/driver-x64-restrictions)\n to prevent disruptive behavior from kernel driver types like anti-malware.\n\nIn addition, all drivers signed by the Microsoft Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) must run a series of tests and attest to a number of quality checks, including using [fuzzers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/hlk/testref/236b8ad5-0ba1-4075-80a6-ae9dafb71c94)\n, running [static code analysis](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/prefast-for-drivers-warnings)\n and testing under [runtime driver verification](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/driver-verifier)\n, among other techniques. These tests have been developed to ensure that best practices around security and reliability are followed. Microsoft includes all these tools in the Windows Driver Kit used by all driver developers. A list of the resources and tools is [available here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/driversecurity/driver-security-checklist)\n.\n\nAll WHQL signed drivers are run through Microsoft\u2019s ingestion checks and malware scans and must pass before being approved for signing. Additionally, if a third-party vendor chooses to distribute their driver via Windows Update (WU), the driver also goes through Microsoft\u2019s flighting and gradual rollout processes to observe quality and ensure the driver meets the necessary quality criteria for a broad release.\n\nCan customers deploy Windows in a higher security mode to increase reliability?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWindows at its core is an open and versatile OS, and it can easily be locked down for increased security using integrated tools. In addition, Windows is constantly increasing security defaults, including dozens of new security features enabled by default in Windows 11.\n\n### Security features enabled by default in Windows 11\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Area** | **Feature** |\n| **Hardware Security Baseline** | [TPM2.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/hardware-security/tpm/tpm-fundamentals)<br>  <br>[Secure boot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/user-help/you-need-to-enable-secure-boot-windows)<br>  <br>[Virtualization-based security (VBS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-vbs)<br>[Memory integrity (Hypervisor-protected Code Integrity (HVCI))](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/hardware-security/enable-virtualization-based-protection-of-code-integrity)<br>[Hardware-enforced stack protection](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-os-platform-blog/understanding-hardware-enforced-stack-protection/ba-p/1247815)<br>[Kernel Direct Memory Access (DMA) protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/hardware-security/kernel-dma-protection-for-thunderbolt)<br>HW-based kernel protection (HLAT)  <br>[Enhanced sign-in security (ESS) for built-in biometric sensors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/windows-hello-enhanced-sign-in-security) |\n| **Encryption** | [BitLocker](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/data-protection/bitlocker/)<br> (commercial)  <br>[Device Encryption](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/data-protection/bitlocker/#device-encryption)<br> (consumer) |\n| **Identity Management** | [Credential Guard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/)<br>[Entra primary refresh token (PRT) hardware protected](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-token-protection)<br>MDM deployed SCEP certs hardware protected  <br>MDM enrollment certs hardware protected  <br>Local Security Authority (LSA) PPL prevents token/credential dumping  <br>Account lockout policy (for 10 failed sign-ins)  <br>Enhanced phishing protection with Microsoft Defender  <br>[Microsoft Defender SmartScreen](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/virus-and-threat-protection/microsoft-defender-smartscreen/)<br>NPLogonNotification doesn\u2019t include password  <br>WDigest SSO removed to reduce password disclosure  <br>AD Device Account protected by CredGuard\\* |\n| **Multi-Factor Authentication  <br>(Passwordless)** | MSA & Entra users lead through Hello enablement by default  <br>MSA password automatically removed from Windows if never used  <br>Hello container VSM protected  <br>Peripheral biometric sensors blocked for ESS enabled devices  <br>Lock on leave integrated into Hello |\n| **Security Incident Reduction** | Common Log File Systems run from trusted source  <br>Move tool-tip APIs from kernel to user mode  <br>Modernize print stack by removing untrusted drivers  <br>DPAPI moved from 3DES to AES  <br>TLS 1.3 default with TLS 1.0/1.1 disabled by default  <br>NTLM-less\\* |\n| **OS lockdown** | [Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/windows-defender-application-control/design/microsoft-recommended-driver-block-rules#microsoft-vulnerable-driver-blocklist)<br>3P driver security baseline enforced via WHCP  <br>Smart App Control\\* |\n\n\\*Feature available in the Windows Insider Program or currently off by default and on a path for default enablement\n\nWindows has integrated security features to self-defend. This includes key anti-malware features enabled by default, such as:\n\n1.  [Secure Boot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/system-security/secure-the-windows-10-boot-process)\n    , which helps prevent early boot malware and rootkits by enforcing signing consistently across Windows boots.\n2.  [Measured Boot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/system-security/secure-the-windows-10-boot-process)\n    , which provides TPM-based hardware cryptographic measurements on boot-time properties available through integrated attestation services such as [Device Health Attestation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/device-health-attestation)\n    .\n3.  [Memory integrity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/bringup/device-guard-and-credential-guard)\n     (also known as hypervisor-protected code integrity or HVCI), which prevents runtime generation of dynamic code in the kernel and helps ensure control flow integrity.\n4.  [Vulnerable driver blocklist](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/windows-defender-application-control/design/microsoft-recommended-driver-block-rules#microsoft-vulnerable-driver-blocklist)\n    , which is on by default, integrated into the OS, and managed by Microsoft. This complements the malicious driver block list.\n5.  [Protected Local Security Authority](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/credentials-protection-and-management/configuring-additional-lsa-protection)\n     is on by default in Windows 11 to protect a range of credentials. [Hardware-based credential protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/?toc=%2Fwindows-server%2Fsecurity%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fwindows-server%2Fbreadcrumbs%2Ftoc.json)\n     is on by default for enterprise versions of Windows.\n6.  [Microsoft Defender Antivirus](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-antivirus-windows)\n     is enabled by default in Windows and offers anti-malware capabilities across the OS.\n\nThese security capabilities provide layers of protection against malware and exploitation attempts in modern Windows. Many Windows customers have leveraged our security baseline and Windows security technologies to harden their systems and these capabilities collectively have reduced the attack surface significantly.\n\nUsing the integrated security features of Windows to prevent adversary attacks such as those displayed in the [MITRE ATT&CK\u00ae framework](https://attack.mitre.org/)\n increases security while reducing cost and complexity. It leverages best practices to achieve maximum security and reliability. These best practices include:\n\n1.  Using [App Control for Business](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/windows-defender-application-control/)\n     (formerly Windows Defender Application Control), you can author a security policy to allow only trusted and/or business-critical apps. Your policy can be crafted to deterministically and durably prevent nearly all malware and \u201cliving off the land\u201d style attacks. It can also specify which kernel drivers are allowed by your organization to durably guarantee that only those drivers will load on your managed endpoints.\n2.  Use [Memory integrity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/bringup/device-guard-and-credential-guard)\n     with a [specific allow list policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/windows-defender-application-control/design/wdac-wizard)\n     to further protect the Windows kernel using [Virtualization-based security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-vbs)\n     (VBS). Combined with App Control for Business, memory integrity can reduce the attack surface for kernel malware or boot kits. This can also be used to limit any drivers that might impact reliability on systems.\n3.  Running as [Standard User](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/multipoint-services/create-a-standard-user-account)\n     and elevating only as necessary. Companies that follow the best practices to run as standard user and reduce privileges mitigate many of the [MITRE ATT&CK\u00ae](https://attack.mitre.org/)\n     techniques.\n4.  Use [Device Health Attestation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/device-health-attestation)\n     (DHA) to monitor devices for the right security policy, including hardware-based measurements for the security posture of the machine. This is a modern and exceptionally durable approach to ensure security for high availability scenarios and uses Microsoft\u2019s [Zero Trust architecture](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-zero-trust-architecture?msockid=04462a6256e861da2e753a3d57346023)\n    .\n\nWhat is next?\n-------------\n\nWindows is a self-protecting operating system that has produced dozens of new security features and architectural changes [in recent versions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/05/20/new-windows-11-features-strengthen-security-to-address-evolving-cyberthreat-landscape/)\n. We plan to work with the anti-malware ecosystem to take advantage of these integrated features to modernize their approach, helping to support and even increase security along with reliability.\n\nThis includes helping the ecosystem by:\n\n1.  Providing safe rollout guidance, best practices, and technologies to make it safer to perform updates to security products.\n2.  Reducing the need for kernel drivers to access important security data.\n3.  Providing enhanced isolation and anti-tampering capabilities with technologies like our recently [announced VBS enclaves](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-os-platform-blog/securely-design-your-applications-and-protect-your-sensitive/ba-p/4179543)\n    .\n4.  Enabling zero trust approaches like [high integrity attestation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/attestation/overview)\n     which provides a method to determine the security state of the machine based on the health of Windows native security features.\n\nAs we move forward, Windows is continuing to innovate and offer new ways for security tools to detect and respond to emerging threats safely and securely. Windows has [announced a commitment around the Rust programming language](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/03/06/enhancing-protection-updates-on-microsofts-secure-future-initiative/)\n as part of Microsoft\u2019s [Secure Future Initiative](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-cloud/resources/secure-future-initiative)\n (SFI) and has recently expanded the [Windows kernel to support Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T6ClX-y2AE)\n.\n\nThe information in this blog post is provided as part of our commitment to communicate learnings and next steps after the CrowdStrike incident. We will continue to share ongoing guidance on security best practices for Windows and work across our broad ecosystem of customers and partners to develop new security capabilities based on your feedback.\n\n-----\nGenerate comments in a hierarchical structure with 3 comments per level, up to a depth of 3."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n- **rdtsc** (): &gt; We plan to work with the anti-malware ecosystem to take advantage of these integrated features to modernize their approach, helping to support and even increase security along with reliability.<p>&gt; Providing safe rollout guidance, best practices, and technologies to make it safer to perform updates to security products.<p>&gt; Reducing the need for kernel drivers to access important security data.<p>They are being as diplomatic as they can, but it&#x27;s definitely a slap to CS.

Microsoft&#x27;s core competency has traditionally been backwards compatibility, but if each security vendor can tamper with windows at the deepest level and is allowed to continue explore all of the ways that they can leverage that...

The Static Driver Verifier should have caught this.[1] Do some security vendors get to bypass that? Microsoft is very quiet about that.<p>That&#x27;s the sort of thing a negligence lawyer focuses on. Partner at Brown Rudrick: <i>&quot;The most likely legal theory will be one of negligence.

The project went on for some years and finally led to [sudoku.tn1ck.com](https://sudoku.tn1ck.com)\n - a free and [open source](https://github.com/TN1ck/super-sudoku)\n Sudoku app without any tracking. While working on it, I went down the rabbit hole of generating Sudokus of a specified \"human perceived\" difficulty and accidentally created a quite thorough analysis of it.\n\nCreating a Sudoku solver\n------------------------\n\nFirst things first, to generate a Sudoku, we first have to solve one. The solver plays an integral part in the generation part, as we will use the iterations it needed to solve a Sudoku to measure the difficulty.\n\nWe will explore multiple algorithms and benchmark them against each other in how well we can use them to measure the difficulty of a Sudoku. We start with the most basic brute force algorithm and end up with the final one, based on seeing the Sudoku as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (short CSP). We use a depth-first search (short DFS) for all our different strategies here. We abstract this by the following function. We make it Sudoku specific instead of completely generic for ease of use.[1](#footnotes)\n\n\\+ Code of the depth-first search\n\nBrute force version\n\nBrute force version\n\nThis is the most simple strategy to solve the Sudoku: We find an empty spot and fill in a number between 1 - 9. We don\u2019t do anything else. This is horribly slow; do not try this at home.\n\nEasy sudokuMedium sudokuHard sudokuEvil sudoku\n\nSolveResetStep\n\nTime between each step (ms)\n\nIterations: 0\n\nStack size: 1\n\n1\n\n6\n\n7\n\n4\n\n8\n\n9\n\n7\n\n2\n\n6\n\n3\n\n8\n\n2\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n1\n\n4\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n2\n\n1\n\n8\n\n6\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n2\n\n4\n\n8\n\n1\n\n6\n\n5\n\n7\n\n\\+ Code of the brute force strategy\n\nSkip on invalid Sudokus\n\nSkip on invalid Sudokus\n\nThe simplest and most substantial change we can do is not waiting until the whole Sudoku is filled but skipping on the Sudokus that are already invalid. This solver will solve even the hardest Sudokus in adequate time, but it still wastes a lot of cycles as it is not choosing the cell to fill with a value with any strategy.\n\nEasy sudokuMedium sudokuHard sudokuEvil sudoku\n\nSolveResetStep\n\nTime between each step (ms)\n\nIterations: 0\n\nStack size: 1\n\n1\n\n6\n\n7\n\n4\n\n8\n\n9\n\n7\n\n2\n\n6\n\n3\n\n8\n\n2\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n1\n\n4\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n2\n\n1\n\n8\n\n6\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n2\n\n4\n\n8\n\n1\n\n6\n\n5\n\n7\n\n\\+ Code of the improved brute force\n\nMinimum remaining value\n\nMinimum remaining value\n\n\"Minimum remaining value\" is a heuristic we can use to not search blindly, but to select the cell next with the least amount of possibilities. This is something a human would do as well - fill or work on the cells with the least options. This greatly reduces the number of iterations needed for the difficult Sudoku. This algorithm is pretty solid now as it can solve even the hardest Sudokus in the millisecond range.\n\nEasy sudokuMedium sudokuHard sudokuEvil sudoku\n\nSolveResetStep\n\nTime between each step (ms)\n\nIterations: 0\n\nStack size: 1\n\n1\n\n6\n\n7\n\n4\n\n8\n\n9\n\n7\n\n2\n\n6\n\n3\n\n8\n\n2\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n1\n\n4\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n2\n\n1\n\n8\n\n6\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n2\n\n4\n\n8\n\n1\n\n6\n\n5\n\n7\n\n\\+ Code of the minimum remaining value strategy\n\nArc Consistency\n\nArc Consistency\n\nWe now embark on a different way to solve the Sudoku, namely framing it as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem to solve it and then use Arc Consistency to simplify the problem. A quick primer on some computer science terms.\n\n*   **Domain** - A domain is the set of possible values for a variable. For a Sudoku, this is the numbers 1 - 9.\n*   **CSP** - A constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is a problem defined by a set of variables, a set of domains, and a set of constraints. The goal is to assign a value to each variable such that the constraints are satisfied. For a Sudoku, the variables are the cells, the domains are the numbers 1 - 9, and the constraints are that every row, column, and square has to have unique numbers.\n*   **Arc consistency** - A variable is arc-consistent with another variable if every value in the domain of the first variable has a possible value in the domain of the second variable that satisfies the constraint between the two variables.  \n    In the Sudoku example, if we have two cells in the same row, one with the domain \\[1, 2, 3\\] and the other with the domain \\[2\\], this is not arc consistent as 2 is in the domain of the first cell. If we remove the 2 from the domain of the first cell, it becomes arc consistent.\n*   **AC3** - The AC3 algorithm is an algorithm to create arc consistency. The main difference from the complete naive way to achieve arc consistency is that we do not loop over all constraints again when a domain of a variable changes, but only the relevant variables that have a constraint with it (in Sudoku the cells in the same row/column/square).\n\nFor every cell in the Sudoku, we keep track of its possible values. We reduce the possible values for every cell by checking the Sudoku constraints e.g. remove the numbers that are already in the same row/column/square. We do this as long until no domain is changing anymore. This \"reduction of domains using the constraints\" is arc consistency.\n\nFor very simple Sudokus, this is already enough to solve one (see the applet below), for harder ones, we are left with multiple options for every unfilled cell. This means we have to employ a search again. We use then the \"Minimum remaining value\" strategy again to select the cell with the least options and create new versions of the Sudoku with that cell filled with the possible values. This is called \"domain splitting\" in fancy computer science terms. We again count the number of iterations needed to solve the Sudoku.\n\nThe applet shows the domains of the applied AC3 algorithm in unfilled cells. If a Sudoku cannot be solved, one domain will become empty, which is shown as red, then the algorithm will backtrack.\n\nEasy sudokuMedium sudokuHard sudokuEvil sudoku\n\nSolveResetStep\n\nTime between each step (ms)\n\nIterations: 0\n\nStack size: 1\n\n1\n\n6\n\n7\n\n4\n\n8\n\n9\n\n7\n\n2\n\n6\n\n3\n\n8\n\n2\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n1\n\n4\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n2\n\n1\n\n8\n\n6\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n2\n\n4\n\n8\n\n1\n\n6\n\n5\n\n7\n\n\\+ Code of the Arc consistency strategy\n\n### Rating the difficulty of Sudokus\n\nThe main problem that one faces when generating a Sudoku is to assign the difficulty rating for a human solver. As we don\u2019t want to manually verify every Sudoku we generate, we need an automatic way for us to group a newly generated Sudoku according to its difficulty. All our Sudoku solvers yield an iteration count, which we will use as our cost function. I'm relying here on the paper \"Rating and generating Sudoku puzzles based on constraint satisfaction problems.\" by Fatemi, Bahare, Seyed Mehran Kazemi, and Nazanin Mehrasa.[2](#footnotes)\n  \nIn the paper, they download Sudokus of each difficulty section from websudoku.com, solve them by ~students~ volunteers, and then run their algorithm on it. They then took the average of each category and so they got an iteration-to-difficulty mapping.\n\nWe will do basically the same, but actually publish the data and also try out how the \"lesser\" strategies work here for rating the difficulty. I fetched 100 Sudokus from websudoku.com (easy, medium, hard, evil) for each of its difficulty classes as well as from sudoku.com (easy, medium, hard, expert, master, extreme).\n\n### How well do the solvers measure human difficulty?\n\nI'm not a data scientist, so take this analysis with a grain of salt, and I'm happy for any comments/proposals on how to improve it. As I don't have comments here yet, you can open an issue at [the GitHub repository of this analysis](https://github.com/TN1ck/sudoku-analysis)\n instead.\n\nThis is the raw data on how many iterations each solver took to solve the Sudokus. You can also execute it yourself [here](/apps/benchmark-sudokus)\n or look at the source [at GitHub](https://github.com/TN1ck/tn1ck.com/blob/main/pages/apps/benchmark-sudokus.tsx)\n. I skipped the most simple brute force, as it would take ages to compute even medium difficult Sudokus.\n\n**For all the charts, I used the logarithm on the iterations as especially the qq plot made it very obvious that the iterations count is exponential to the difficulty.** Which is not surprising as solving Sudokus is famously NP hard. Any currently known algorithms to solve an NP-hard problem take exponential time.\n\nHistograms\n\nHistograms\n\nFirst let's draw a histogram of each strategy and each dataset to get an idea of the distribution. From that, we can see that they seem to be more or less normally distributed (with the applied logarithm), especially the brute force algorithm.  \nBoth the minimum remaining value and arc consistency algorithm look the same, but only for the more difficult levels as for the easy ones, they always need the same number of iterations.\n\nBrute Force w. skipMinimum Remaining ValueArc Consistency\n\n![](https://tn1ck.com/how-to-generate-sudokus/benchmark_bruteForceWithValidCheck.csv_histograms.png)\n\nQQ plots\n\nQQ plots\n\nThen we look at the QQ plots for each strategy/source/level combination. QQ plots are super cool to get an intuitive understanding of how the values are distributed. A perfect normal distribution would be a straight line. These lines also look pretty straight, but only because we used the logarithm on the iterations count already. For the minimum remaining value and arc consistency, the lower difficulty levels look much less like a straight line, but the higher difficulty levels look very much like it. This is explained with their very low iteration count for the easy Sudokus.\n\nBrute Force w. skipMinimum Remaining ValueArc Consistency\n\n![](https://tn1ck.com/how-to-generate-sudokus/benchmark_bruteForceWithValidCheck.csv_qq_plots.png)\n\nCorrelation\n\nCorrelation\n\nWe can already see that these graphs all look somewhat alike, even the second most basic brute force looks decently similar to our fancy CSP algorithm. But do the numbers agree? How much do the iterations correlate with the level?\n\nBrute Force w. skipMinimum Remaining ValueArc Consistency\n\n![](https://tn1ck.com/how-to-generate-sudokus/benchmark_bruteForceWithValidCheck.csv_correlation.png)\n\nAs we can see, they all correlate almost perfectly with the brute force having a perfect 1.0 correlation, making it highly likely that the websites use the iteration count as well for their level determination - and this makes the whole analysis problematic, as we still don't know if this is actually a good difficulty indicator for how a human perceives the difficulty. Actually solving Sudokus by a human and rating them by the time to get a ground truth is left as an exercise for the reader (Sorry I'm not paid for this.)\n\nGenerating a Sudoku with a specific difficulty\n\nGenerating a Sudoku with a specific difficulty\n\nTo now generate a Sudoku of a specific difficulty, we do the following:\n\n1.  Start with an empty grid and fill it with random numbers until it is a valid (and unique) Sudoku. We backtrack when the added number will lead to a non-solvable Sudoku. Note: The uniqueness constraint comes automatically as we continue to fill the Sudoku with numbers. Instead of stopping when it is unique, we could also stop when it is fully filled, but that wouldn't be helpful as we would have to delete numbers again in the next step.\n2.  To generate a Sudoku of a wanted difficulty, we either remove numbers or add numbers until the reached difficulty is achieved.\n3.  If we cannot delete any more numbers without making it non-unique, meaning we reached max difficulty, but the difficulty is below the requested one, start at 1 again. Note: We could also backtrack or add numbers again, but for my personal use, I found it better to save the Sudoku with the maximum achieved difficulty and start over, but by adding and removing numbers, one could theoretically reach the requested difficulty.\n4.  If the call count is close to the requested value, return the Sudoku.\n\nAs point 3 points out, generating very difficult Sudokus can take quite some time as any generation method will struggle with the uniqueness constraint and has to randomly alter the Sudoku generation steps. Here is an applet for you to interactively run the Sudoku.

Here is how they describe the algorithm:\n\n> \"We use hill climbing to generate new puzzles having a call count close to the call count we need. In this method, first of all, we generate an initial puzzle with some random numbers inside it and calculate its cost function. Then in each iteration, we randomly change one element of this solution by adding, deleting, or changing a single number and calculate the cost function again.  \n> After this, we check the new value of the cost function for this new puzzle and compare it to the previous one. If the cost is reduced, we accept the second puzzle as the new solution and otherwise, we undo the change. We do this process until meeting the stopping criterion.  \n> The cost function for a given puzzle is infinity for puzzles with none or more than one solution. For other puzzles, the cost is the absolute value of the current puzzle\u2019s call count minus the average call count of the given difficulty level. For example, if we want to generate an easy puzzle and we want to consider the values demonstrated in Table I, then the cost function for a puzzle having a unique solution is the absolute value of its call count minus 6.234043.  \n> We stop the algorithm when we have puzzles with costs close to zero. Depending on the level of accuracy we need and the number of difficulty levels we have, we can define the closeness of the cost function to zero.\"\n\nWhen I first read it, I thought \"we generate an initial puzzle with some random numbers inside it\" would mean that I could literally start with a Sudoku grid and put random numbers in it.  \nBut one needs an already valid Sudoku as else the hill climbing will not work as the cost function for an invalid configuration should return infinite. While theoretically it still works, it takes far too long to stumble upon a valid configuration like this.\n\nI\u2019m not entirely sure if they meant to start with a valid Sudoku, but \"initial puzzle with some random numbers\" does not sound like it. Furthermore, \"just adding, deleting, or changing a single number\" is not efficient, as again, this can lead to an invalid configuration quickly, albeit the hill climbing will take care of that if you were in a valid configuration before.\n\nI find my algorithm to be more efficient and elegant as it is guided by the Sudoku's constraints, namely we first create a solvable and unique Sudoku, making the hill climbing afterwards easier as our cost function will not return infinity. Their algorithm will spend most of their time trying to stumble upon a valid Sudoku.\n\n### Footnotes\n\n1.

The puzzles are all handmade, and many of them have some specific reason to exist: e.g. there&#x27;s at least one which is clearly intended to teach you the swordfish pattern, and there are a few which appear to be built around some beautiful one-off ideas.\n  - **0xFF0123** (): Cracking the cryptic is fantastic. The beauty in the setting of some of their showcased puzzles is truly wonderful to watch get solved.\n    - **Skeime** (): And it is such a fantastic resource to learn! You want to get into puzzles like they do on the channel? Just open a video, pause it, and click the link in the description. Stare at the puzzle, trying to figure it out. The first time you do this, you probably won&#x27;t. Once you lose patience (but give yourself some time!), watch the video until Simon or Mark get to the first deduction and explain it. Pause the video again, and try to continue using your new knowledge. When you get stuck again, what (or skim) through the video until they do enter a deduction that you have not found. Rinse and repeat.<p>Do this a couple of times with different videos, and you will start to build a repertoire of techniques yourself. At some point, you will be capable of solving puzzles on your own. (And if you get stuck, the video is there to help you.)\n    - **ziml77** (): I love the feeling of finding the beauty of how a puzzle resolves. The hand set puzzles are as much a challenge to player as they are a demonstration of the setter&#x27;s own skill and cleverness.\n  - **cdingo** (): Cracking The Cryptic also has a &quot;Genuinely Approachable Sudoku&quot; community (Discord is the only public feed I&#x27;m aware of), where a handmade puzzle using all sorts of Sudoku variants is posted daily.\n  - **robin_reala** (): There\u2019s also the self-titled \u201cCracking the Cryptic\u201d app that has a bunch of handmade Sudoku &amp; friends puzzles that range in difficulty from pretty tricky up to fiendish.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crackingthecryptic.com&#x2F;#apps\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crackingthecryptic.com&#x2F;#apps</a>\n- **TN1ck** (): Hi! I&#x27;m the author, didn&#x27;t expect this to be posted here yet. I was still somewhat working on it, so please bear with me when you find anything weird. You can give me any feedback here.\n  - **nhatcher** (): Such a beautifully written blog! I have no comments so far, but I will read it through tonight again.<p>I wrote a Sudoku solver using a SAT solver compiled to wasm (it is just a simple exercise TBH):<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nhatcher.com&#x2F;hats&#x2F;sudoku.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nhatcher.com&#x2F;hats&#x2F;sudoku.html</a>\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nhatcher.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;on-hats-and-sats&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nhatcher.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;on-hats-and-sats&#x2F;</a>\n    - **TN1ck** (): Thank you and all the others here for the kind words, means a lot:)<p>And the WASM solver is super cool, definitely useful for generating them as you have to do quite a lot of iterations!\n  - **jcynix** (): I&#x27;ll second that: great article and description of the problem space. Love it.<p>Once upon a time I programmed a solution finder for the game <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ricochet_Robots\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ricochet_Robots</a> because a gaming magazine had monthly problems to solve. But I wasn&#x27;t allowed to run my program until my wife found a solution manually first ;-)\n  - **alexworks** (): Your article is fantastic. I really like the way you present information, especially with the interactive examples.<p>I&#x27;ve been playing a lot with the logic programming language, Prolog. Sudoku is a popular &quot;hello world&quot; for it.<p>If you haven&#x27;t used Prolog before, here&#x27;s an example of a Sudoku solver. It uses Prolog&#x27;s Constraint Logic Programming over Finite Domains library -- CLP(FD) -- a form of CSP.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swish.swi-prolog.org&#x2F;example&#x2F;clpfd_sudoku.pl\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swish.swi-prolog.org&#x2F;example&#x2F;clpfd_sudoku.pl</a><p>The relation on line 8 basically encodes the rules of Sudoku verbatim. Logic programming is cool (at least to me) because relations can be run in any direction with any number of variables.<p>I wonder how writing a Sudoku puzzle generator would differ in a language that had first-class support for CSP.\n- **lifebeyondfife** (): The exponential number of symmetries present in sudoku problems, means that once you&#x27;ve found one valid instance, you&#x27;ve actually found up to 9! * 3!^4 * 8 which are exactly the same.<p>The numbers themselves are all interchangeable, so you have 9! combinations: 362,880.<p>Columns 1-to-3 are all interchangeable, as are 4-to-6, and 7-to-9. On top of this, these blocks of columns (1-to-3, 4-to-6, 7-to-9) are all interchangeable. Read about wreath products in group theory to know more. Each of the above symmetries are 3!, combined to yield 3! * 3! = 36 combinations. As well as the columns though, the rows have the same property, so those can be combined too: 36 * 36 = \n1,296.<p>Finally, there are the symmetries of a square. Combining all rotations and flips yields a further 8.<p>In total, sudoku has 3,762,339,840 symmetries. Owing to the starting state of the sudoku puzzle being incomplete, the orbit of the set of points (more group theory) will be smaller than 3 billion, but it provides an efficient method of recreating many more puzzles with the same property. In this case, human complexity.\n  - **xjm** (): I counted one trillion or 9! * 3!^8 * 2 : the 8 because you have can choose 3 independent permutations of columns inside column blocks + 1 permutation of column blocks, plus same for rows. Then only one rotation should be counted, because flips are included in col&#x2F;row permutations.<p>I think wreath products relate to the second sentence; see this page, which mentions the same result: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mathematics_of_Sudoku#The_sudoku_symmetry_group\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mathematics_of_Sudoku#The_sudo...</a>\n    - **lifebeyondfife** (): You&#x27;re correct, the horizontal and vertical flips for the square, are already accounted for in the wreath product. And I miscounted the products themselves. Up to 1.2*10^12 symmetries.\n"}]}

It's designed to find semantically similar matches to the query, going beyond simple string matching. The experience is designed to be similar to grep.\n\nExample Usage\n-------------\n\n[](#example-usage)\n\nSearch for words similar to \"death\" in Hemingway's \"The Old Man and the Sea\" with context and line numbers:\n\n```shell\ncurl -s 'https://gutenberg.ca/ebooks/hemingwaye-oldmanandthesea/hemingwaye-oldmanandthesea-00-t.txt' \\\n    | sgrep -C 2 -n -threshold 0.55 death\n```\n\nOutput: [![alt text](https://github.com/arunsupe/semantic-grep/raw/main/demo/image.png)](/arunsupe/semantic-grep/blob/main/demo/image.png)\n\nThis command:\n\n    - Fetches the text of \"The Old Man and the Sea\" from Project Gutenberg Canada\n    - Pipes the text to sgrep\n    - Searches for words semantically similar to \"death\"\n    - Uses a similarity threshold of 0.55 (-threshold 0.55)\n    - Displays 2 lines of context before and after each match (-C 2)\n    - Shows line numbers (-n)\n    \n\nThe output will show matches with their similarity scores, highlighted words, context, and line numbers.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n[](#features)\n\n*   Semantic search using Word2Vec embeddings\n*   Configurable similarity threshold\n*   Context display (before and after matching lines)\n*   Color-coded output for matched words and line numbers\n*   Support for reading from files or standard input\n*   Configurable via JSON file and command-line arguments\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n[](#installation)\n\n**Using install script**:\n\n```shell\n# clone\ngit clone https://github.com/arunsupe/semantic-grep.git\ncd semantic-grep\n\n# run install:\n#   compiles using the local go compiler, installs in user/bin, \n#   downloads the model to $HOME/.config/semantic-grep\n#   makes config.json\nbash install.sh\n```\n\n**Binary**:\n\n1.  Download the latest binary release\n2.  Download a word2vec model (see below)\n3.  Optionally, download the config.json to configure model location there (or do this from the command line)\n\n**From source (linux/osx)**:\n\n```shell\n# clone\ngit clone https://github.com/arunsupe/semantic-grep.git\ncd semantic-grep\n\n# build\ngo build -o sgrep\n\n# download a word2vec model using this helper script (see \"Word2Vec Model\" below)\nbash download-model.sh\n```\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n[](#usage)\n\nBasic usage:\n\n./sgrep \\[options\\] \\[file\\]\n\nIf no file is specified, sgrep reads from standard input.\n\n### Command-line Options\n\n[](#command-line-options)\n\n*   `-model_path`: Path to the Word2Vec model file (overrides config file)\n*   `-threshold`: Similarity threshold for matching (default: 0.7)\n*   `-A`: Number of lines to display after a match\n*   `-B`: Number of lines to display before a match\n*   `-C`: Number of lines to display before and after a match\n*   `-n`: Print line numbers\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\n[](#configuration)\n\n*   sgrep can be configured using a JSON file. By default, it looks for `config.json` in the current directory.\n\nExample `config.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"model_path\": \"path/to/your/word2vec/model.bin\"\n}\n```\n\nWord2Vec Model\n--------------\n\n[](#word2vec-model)\n\n*   sgrep requires a Word2Vec model in binary format. You can use pre-trained models like Google's Word2Vec model or train your own using tools like gensim.\n*   Download and unzip the .bin file locally and update the config.json.\n    *   Google's Word2Vec: from [https://github.com/mmihaltz/word2vec-GoogleNews-vectors](https://github.com/mmihaltz/word2vec-GoogleNews-vectors)\n        \n    *   A slim version: GoogleNews-vectors-negative300-SLIM.bin.gz model from [https://github.com/eyaler/word2vec-slim/](https://github.com/eyaler/word2vec-slim/)\n         (thanks to eyaler)\n*   download-model.sh is a simple helper script to download the small word2vec model hosted by eyaler and save it in models/googlenews-slim/ directory\n\nContributing\n------------\n\n[](#contributing)\n\nContributions are welcome!

Good BLAS libraries have SIMD-optimized implementations. Or if you do multiple tokens as once, you can do a matrix-vector multiplication (sgemv), which will be even faster in many implementations. Alternatively, there is probably also a SIMD implementation in Go using assembly (it has been 7 years since I looked at anything in the Go ecosystem).<p>You could also normalize the vectors while loading. Then during runtime the cosine similarity is just the dot product of the vectors (whether it pays off depends on the size of your embedding matrix and the size of the haystack that you are going to search).\n  - **neonsunset** (): SIMD situation in Go is still rather abysmal, it\u2019s likely easier to just FFI (though FFI is very slow so I guess you&#x27;re stuck with ugly go asm if you are using short vectors). As usual, there&#x27;s a particular high-level language that does it very well, and has standard vector similarity function nowadays...\n    - **bitexploder** (): Go ahead and share the language, it is good etiquette for HN :)\n- **onli** (): That&#x27;s totally clever and sound really useful. And it&#x27;s one of those ideas where you go &quot;Why didn&#x27;t I think of that&quot; when stumbling over the materials, word2vec in this case.\n  - **ignoramous** (): &gt; <i>Why didn&#x27;t I think of that</i><p>Well, Apple did experiment with <i>embeddings</i> for next word prediction on iOS in 2018 (apparently, they also used it for many other features)! <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;machinelearning.apple.com&#x2F;research&#x2F;can-global-semantic-context-improve-neural-language-models\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;machinelearning.apple.com&#x2F;research&#x2F;can-global-semant...</a> &#x2F; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;1oCwr\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;1oCwr</a>\n- **throw156754228** (): The model of a word to a vector breaks down really quickly one you introduce the context and complexity of human language. That&#x27;s why we went to contextual embeddings, but even they have issues.<p>Curious would it handle negation of trained keywords, e.g &quot;not urgent&quot;?\n  - **VHRanger** (): For a lot of cases, word2vec&#x2F;glove still work plenty well. It also runs much faster and lighter when doing development -- the FSE library [1] does 0.5M sentences&#x2F;sec on CPU, whereas the fastest sentence_transformers [2] do something like 20k sentences&#x2F;sec on a V100 (!!).<p>For the drawbacks:<p>Word embeddings are only good at similarity search style queries - stuff like paraphrasing.<p>Negation they&#x27;ll necessarily struggle with. Since word embeddings are generally summed or averaged into a sentence embedding, a negation won&#x27;t shift the sentence vector space around the way it would in a LM embedding.<p>Also things like homonyms are issues, but this is massively overblown as a reason to use LM embeddings (at least for latin&#x2F;germanic languages).<p>Most people use LM embeddings because they&#x27;ve been told it&#x27;s the best thing by other people rather than benchmarking accuracy and performance for their usecase.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oborchers&#x2F;Fast_Sentence_Embeddings\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oborchers&#x2F;Fast_Sentence_Embeddings</a><p>2. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sbert.net&#x2F;docs&#x2F;sentence_transformer&#x2F;pretrained_models.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sbert.net&#x2F;docs&#x2F;sentence_transformer&#x2F;pretrained_m...</a>\n  - **arunsupe** (): This implementation does not because the query has to be a word. One way to extend it to phrases is to average the vectors of each word in the phrase. Another way is to have a word2vec model that embeds phrases. (The large Google News model I think does have phrases, with spaces converted to underscore). But going from words to phrases opens up a whole new can of worms - how large a phrase to consider from the input stream etc. Plus, I don&#x27;t think averaging words in the phrase is the same as learning the embedding for the phrase. Sentence embedding models are necessary for that, but they are far too slow for this use case as pointed out by others.<p>To summarize, this is a simple implementation that works for the simplest use case - semantic matching of words.\n    - **vunderba** (): Yep, it would almost be easier to:<p>- check to see if the search query contains more than one word<p>- spin up a more modestly sized LLM, such as mistral 7b<p>- ask the LLM to try to condense &#x2F; find single word synonym for the user query<p>- send to sgrep\n  - **djoldman** (): Definitely a limitation of word2vec as applied here.<p>Something like SBERT addresses this.\n"}]}

The answer is most certainly yes. There is actually a very similar case that was brought to court a few years ago regarding the [OVH incident](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incendie_du_centre_de_donn%C3%A9es_d%27OVHcloud_%C3%A0_Strasbourg)\n, in France. While it applies to France, which is the jurisdiction I am the most familiar with, the same principles will apply to many other jurisdictions.\n\nOne quick note to clear a common misconception before we begin. Most contracts have boilerplate terms to waive liability, there is a common misconception that they may waive liability, however they do not. These terms have no meaning in most jurisdiction outside of the US and either way, it\u2019s not possible to waive liability in most circumstances (e.g. anything involving gross negligence, criminal activities or going against the law itself).\n\nAbout OVH\n---------\n\nOVH is a French datacenter and cloud provider, allegedly the largest hosting provider in Europe. They are most known for providing physical servers and virtual machines, as well as a variety of cloud services.\n\nA fire broke out on 10th March 2021 in their SGB location. It burned down two datacenters SGB1 SGB2 with little or no recovery and rendered two more datacenters SGB3 SGB4 inoperable for a while.\n\nWhat is interesting is the aftermath. Multiple sites were destroyed causing irrecoverable loss of service and loss of data to their customers. Multiple customers pursued them in court for damages and they won.\n\nI found there were a few interesting points raised and discussed by the court:\n\n*   (Skipping the elements about the fire itself, to focus on the service and tech)\n*   There was complete loss of service during and after the event\n*   There was complete irrecoverable loss of data after the event\n*   OVH provided a backup service for their machines and services\n*   There was complete irrevocable loss of the backups after the event\n*   There were multiple datacenters in nearby locations, as is standard practice to provide some resiliency: SGB1 SGB2 SGB3 SGB4\n*   Multiple datacenters burned down at once.\n*   The multiple datacenters were in fact in the same place, a few steps apart. That was considered unexpected and not reasonable by the court.\n*   The backups were stored in the same datacenter or in the other datacenter that might happen to be in the same place. That was not considered reasonable by the court.\n*   OVH tried to argue that customers should have followed good practice of having multiple backups in separate locations. The court acknowledged it was the good practice.\n*   The court determined OVH was the backup provider, the court determined it was the role of OVH to provide backups to a reasonable standard and observe good practices. This includes storing a copy of the backup elsewhere as is good practice.\n*   The court ruled the OVH backup service was not operated to a reasonable standard and failed at its purpose.\n\nI find it interesting for techies, the court will judge your tech and what can really be considered best practices. It\u2019s like the ultimate code review \ud83d\ude00\n\nTo summarize how things work: harm done + intent to cause harm or negligence = potential for damages\n\nThere is significant harm caused to customers, as entire businesses were shutdown, often indefinitely with complete data loss and no possibility to recover. There are multiple occurrences of negligence, mistakes or questionable practices in how OVH was operating the service, which lead to the issue. It\u2019s a solid case. There are multiple customers who opened a case against OVH and won. There may be more still being processed.\n\nThat brings us to CrowdStrike. The similarities are striking!\n\nAbout CrowdStrike\n-----------------\n\nCrowdStrike is an anti-virus software that is installed on computers. It\u2019s sometimes called an EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) these days. It\u2019s mostly installed on corporate devices in large companies, as they are required to have a security solution.\n\nCrowdStrike runs on startup of the computer. It is deeply embedding itself into the operating system (Windows or Linux) at a kernel level, to run as soon as possible and before other things start. It monitors what runs, it can block and report anything that it deems suspicious.\n\nOn 19th July 2024, CrowdStrike pushed an update to their software. The update was bugged and crashed any computer it was deployed on. Millions of computers simultaneously received the update across the world and were rendered non functional.\n\nI think there are multiple interesting points to raise and discuss:\n\n*   CrowdStrike runs at startup in a highly privileged mode (kernel driver on Windows) and it starts first.\n*   It can prevent any other software and prevent the system itself from running, whether intentionally to block a threat or accidentally due to a bug or misjudging a non-threat.\n*   It is deployed to millions of corporate devices in industries like banks, travel, supermarket, etc\u2026 it is largely targeted to critical industries and critical devices with confidential information.\n*   It is a highly critical application operating in sensitive environments, which requires extra care to develop and to test.\n*   On the day of the incident, CrowdStrike pushed the updates to millions of critical devices at once\n*   Good practice requires to stage software upgrades.\n*   How was it possible for CrowdStrike to ship a (broken) update to millions of devices in the span of minutes? Was there no testing and no staged rollout?\n*   From discussion online, customers in hospitals have complained about this issue before and requested for CrowdStrike to allow some control on updates. One customers reported they were rejected with a 50 pages memo from CrowdStrike saying they refuse to stage anything.\n*   Does CrowdStrike not have any ability to stage a rollout? They have repeatedly alluded that they did not and/or refused to. That may be in breach of regulated industries they sell to.\n*   CrowdStrike is expected to be heavily tested to not disrupt the (critical) devices it is deployed to.\n*   The update crashed any computer it was deployed to (BSOD).\n*   How was it possible for an ostensibly broken update to not be detected before it was pushed to the outside world?\n*   Does CrowdStrike do any testing whatsoever? Obviously they didn\u2019t or the incident wouldn\u2019t have happened.\n*   It is not an isolated incident. The same thing happened few weeks earlier with the CrowdStrike agent on Linux, nuking the system and there may be other occurrences before.\n*   After the bad update was pushed, it took nearly two hours for CrowdStrike to realize there was a problem and stop the update.\n*   Developers working on critical software are required to monitor a deployment after deploying, to verify it\u2019s working as expected and not causing issues.\n*   What was CrowdStrike doing after deploying? Were they monitoring the deployment? Could they not notice that the update destroyed every machine it was deployed to?\n\n*   All computers were rendered inoperable by CrowdStrike, unable to boot.\n*   For affected companies, that left all their employees with a dead computer, unable to do anything.\n*   It wasn\u2019t possible for users to \u201caccess\u201d the computer to raise a ticket or troubleshoot it.\n*   It was a complete loss of service with no way to recover.\n*   One way to fix the computer was for the IT team to be given the computer and completely reinstall (reimage) it.\n*   Another way that was found later in the day, was for an administrator to access the computer physically AND try to boot in safe mode or recovery mode then delete the driver file for CrowdStrike.\n*   This remediation can only be done with physical access to the affected computer AND by an administrator who has a special password (or USB key with the password) to start a laptop into recovery mode.\n*   It will take weeks for affected companies to physically get a hand on every device, user laptop, desktop and server. It can be thousands to hundreds of thousands of devices to get to.\n*   It will take longer for devices that are enclosed or difficult to access, like screen terminals in an airport, medical devices and machinery in a hospital, elevator panels.\n*   It may be impossible to restore the device if the device is locked down somehow (physically blocked or recovery password unknown).\n*   Employees who require a computer to work are unable to work during all that time.\n*   It is not possible to provide a spare computer to affected users, the spares were affected by the issue too.\n*   Crowstrike is a security software that was meant to keep computers running and protected from threats.\n*   CrowdStrike destroyed the computers it was supposed to protect, it failed at its purpose.\n\nThere is significant harm caused to customers. Businesses were partially or completely shutdown, for days or weeks. There are multiple occurrences of negligence, mistakes and questionable practices in how CrowdStrike was operating the service, which lead to the issue. The issue was not an isolated incident, as people have reported the same thing happened just few weeks before on a lesser scale.\n\nThat should leave CrowdStrike liable wide open to countless claims for damages.\n\nCustomers operating in regulated industries like healthcare, finance, aerospace, transportation, are actually required to test and stage and track changes. [CrowdStrike claims to have a dozen certifications and standards](https://www.crowdstrike.co.uk/why-crowdstrike/crowdstrike-compliance-certification/)\n which require them to follow particular development practices and carry out various level of testing, but they clearly did not. The simple fact that CrowdStrike does not do any of that and actively refuses to, puts them in breach of compliance, which puts customers themselves in breach of compliance by using CrowdStrike. All together, there may be sufficient grounds to unilaterally terminate any CrowdStrike contracts for any customer who wishes to.\n\nAppendix\n--------\n\nAs additional evidence, we can quote [an employee working for BitLocker discussing their testing and rolling methodology](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41007570)\n. BitLocker is a tool to securely encrypt the disk on your computer. It will prevent anybody else from reading any data if the computer is lost or stolen. It\u2019s similarly critical. It\u2019s the first thing to run on startup and nothing can run without it (no data can be loaded from disk). Any mistake or bug in BitLocker would render the computer unable to operate and render all data on it unreadable (full irrecoverable data loss, exactly like the OVH incident). They have many layers of testing, starting with testing on their own computer then their own team then other teams. Do CrowdStrike employees even have CrowdStrike running on their machine?\n\n![](https://thehftguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image.png?w=1024)\n\nAs additional evidence, we can quote another [employee working for a non identified company](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41007575)\n, who claims their company was hit by a previous CrowdStrike issue, they formally requested for CrowdStrike to allow staged rollout, CrowdStrike refused and sent back a 50 pages memo categorically refusing the idea. If that is true, this memo may now constitute critical evidence against CrowdStrike.\n\n![](https://thehftguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-2.png?w=1024)\n\n### Share this article:\n\n*   [Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)](https://thehftguy.com/2024/07/25/crowdstrike-will-be-liable-for-damages-in-france-based-on-the-ovh-precedent/?share=twitter \"Click to share on Twitter\")\n    \n*   [Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)](https://thehftguy.com/2024/07/25/crowdstrike-will-be-liable-for-damages-in-france-based-on-the-ovh-precedent/?share=reddit \"Click to share on Reddit\")\n    \n*   [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)](https://thehftguy.com/2024/07/25/crowdstrike-will-be-liable-for-damages-in-france-based-on-the-ovh-precedent/?share=facebook \"Click to share on Facebook\")\n    \n*   [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)](https://thehftguy.com/2024/07/25/crowdstrike-will-be-liable-for-damages-in-france-based-on-the-ovh-precedent/?share=linkedin \"Click to share on LinkedIn\")\n    \n*   [Click to share on Hacker News (Opens in new window)](https://thehftguy.com/2024/07/25/crowdstrike-will-be-liable-for-damages-in-france-based-on-the-ovh-precedent/?share=custom-1474241584 \"Click to share on Hacker News\")\n    \n*   [Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)](mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20CrowdStrike%20will%20be%20liable%20for%20damages%20in%20France%2C%20based%20on%20the%20OVH%20precedent&body=https%3A%2F%2Fthehftguy.com%2F2024%2F07%2F25%2Fcrowdstrike-will-be-liable-for-damages-in-france-based-on-the-ovh-precedent%2F&share=email \"Click to email a link to a friend\")\n    \n*   [More](#)\n    \n\n*   [Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)](https://thehftguy.com/2024/07/25/crowdstrike-will-be-liable-for-damages-in-france-based-on-the-ovh-precedent/?share=pinterest \"Click to share on Pinterest\")\n    \n*   [Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)](https://thehftguy.com/2024/07/25/crowdstrike-will-be-liable-for-damages-in-france-based-on-the-ovh-precedent/?share=pocket \"Click to share on Pocket\")\n    \n*   [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)](https://thehftguy.com/2024/07/25/crowdstrike-will-be-liable-for-damages-in-france-based-on-the-ovh-precedent/?share=telegram \"Click to share on Telegram\")\n    \n*   [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)](https://thehftguy.com/2024/07/25/crowdstrike-will-be-liable-for-damages-in-france-based-on-the-ovh-precedent/?share=jetpack-whatsapp \"Click to share on WhatsApp\")\n    \n*   [Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)](https://thehftguy.com/2024/07/25/crowdstrike-will-be-liable-for-damages-in-france-based-on-the-ovh-precedent/?share=tumblr \"Click to share on Tumblr\")\n    \n*   [Click to print (Opens in new window)](https://thehftguy.com/2024/07/25/crowdstrike-will-be-liable-for-damages-in-france-based-on-the-ovh-precedent/#print \"Click to print\")\n    \n\nLike Loading...\n\n4 thoughts on \u201cCrowdStrike will be liable for damages in France, based on the OVH\u00a0precedent\u201d\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.

Maybe CrowStrike wouldn\u2019t be expected to be running on a missile or a satellite or a crane or a MRI or an ATM\u2026 or maybe it does. (Can the device run and is expected to have a full OS? Did crowdstrike lobby regulators and governments to require a security software be installed on that category of device?)  \n        Either way, if CrowdStrike is not deployed on a particular critical system, it will be deployed on the system next to it that is required to operate and control it.

We lived the OVH incident live and saw the whole aftermath.<p>OVH was held liable because of the data loss, not for the service interruption. Data loss is something irremediable, permanent, definitive. Some businesses were basically ruined from this incident because they had no more data to operate. To add insult to injury, they sold offsite backups in the datacenter literally meters away. A service interruption, well, shit happens, and this is handled by SLA contracts that both parties agree to. You don&#x27;t ruin a business (read: close a company) for a few days of outage.<p>I doubt CrowdStrike will be held liable for much; from corporations at least. They cannot repay the damage done, or they close the door. The healthcare sector is another beast, but I think it will come to more regulations for critical entities.\n  - **dathinab** (): IMHO it would send really wrong signals if this doesn&#x27;t end up with CrowdStrike closing their doors...<p>like if the largest outage in history was caused by you due to a config parser failing and it looks as far as I can tell that they didn&#x27;t follow industry best practices when it comes to config&#x2F;parsing handling and probably also didn&#x27;t follow some best practices when it comes to kernel module programming then honestly it would be really strange if you didn&#x27;t had to declare bankruptcy due to damage payments (which doesn&#x27;t mean the software is now gone&#x2F;unmaintained, there are a lot of ways to make sure that doesn&#x27;t happen, e.g. MS anyway had interest in buying Falcon).\n    - **627467** (): I understand that CS doesn&#x27;t draw much sympathies even before this happened - from myself included - and it is easy to pin point systemic issues to a single failure point and make it liable and financially responsible for all downstream failures.<p>But this only creates excuses for all other responsible players in this systemic issue - or society at large. Just to pick 1 example: I keep reading comments on how profoundly health care providers were affected and that lead to human life losses.<p>I understand that having &quot;tech&quot; involved in health or any sector is important but are we really wanting to build critical services that grind to halt or have huge efficiency impact when a single vendor fails? Are these service providers not responsible for thinking about failure modes?\n    - **jb3689** (): I don&#x27;t understand why there is so much attention on the deployment and testing side of the coin. Yes, better testing and rollout strategy should have prevented this specific occurrence of a failure. But these strategies aren&#x27;t bulletproof and things go wrong. You need defense in depth, and some responsibility has to lay on the consumer side for that to happen - particularly for fundamental humane industries like transportation and healthcare. These industries should not be allowed to run any software like this - privileged and without controlled rollouts. I&#x27;m all for shaming CrowdStrike&#x27;s lack of focus on reliability, which they deserve, however there&#x27;s a bigger issue here of trying to avoid or mitigate risky dependencies in the first place that I hope we also get to explore.\n    - **JumpCrisscross** (): &gt; <i>it would send really wrong signals if this doesn&#x27;t end up with CrowdStrike closing their doors</i><p>I thought the same until I saw the damage estimates. They\u2019re in the single-digit billions. That\u2019s well below CrowdStrike\u2019s market cap. Unless we\u2019re going hard for retributive justice, liability should be enough.\n  - **sam_goody** (): As I understand it, anyone with bitlocker irretrievably lost all their data.<p>Logic dictates that the more critical the data - the more likely it is gone. An informal anecdotal survey says that alot of users use bitlocker - which means a lot of data loss.<p>EDIT: I see that in many cases one can recover Bitlocker encrypted drives. I wonder how much real data loss there is.\n  - **altdataseller** (): If a business closed down because of the OVH incident, how were the damages calculated? 1x annual revenue? Profit? 5x?\n- **itunpredictable** (): This headline is kind of misleading. It&#x27;s actually someone&#x27;s personal (educated) opinion on a blog, not a statement of fact. Should be something more like &quot;I think CrowdStrike will be liable&quot; or &quot;CrowdStrike should be liable&quot;\n  - **627467** (): the full headline (at this time at least) is more nuanced than seen here in hn: CrowdStrike will be liable for damages in France, based on the OVH precedent.\n    - **crtasm** (): It&#x27;s also in the URL.  Submitter,  please don&#x27;t remove important parts of headlines.\n    - **jncfhnb** (): Doesn\u2019t really make it any less misleading. It is still just an opinion.\n- **siva7** (): It&#x27;s good to remind people that general liability waivers you often find with license agreements have no meaning outside of US jurisdiction if you&#x27;re doing business in another jurisdiction.\n  - **GJim** (): The number of US tech businesses that are surprised they need, or think they can ignore the need, to obey employment and data protection laws when working in other jurisdictions is simply bonkers.\n    - **xxs** (): Well, it&#x27;d be a lot easier if most US entities understood that M&#x2F;d&#x2F;yy(yy) format is rare, or that default to Frankenstein degrees is pretty much the same&#x2F;awkward (even Microsoft reset their weather widget to F on regular basis).<p>The root of issue, not understanding local laws&#x2F;culture, is very similar - surrounded by a vast market&#x2F;culture (US +Canada) dulls your senses for the rest of the globe.\n    - **KingOfCoders** (): When working for a large US company they insisted we do not accept returns, they always were astonished that in Germany there is a law for 14 day returns, no questions asked. They could not understand that this is a law in Germany.\n    - **classified** (): It&#x27;s not unusual in the US to assume the US are the only planet in the universe.\n  - **giantg2** (): I wonder if there is a site that covers common software license and has liability maps by country as to how much liability is waived based on the laws there.\n"}]}

How do you debug your battery? It's a black box of magic right?!? Wrong. Use simulation.\n\nThe **\"and\"** problem\n---------------------\n\n[](#the-and-problem)\n\nIt seems like there's no good solution in the market today. Batteries are either designed to be high energy **or** high power, not high energy **and** power. If we stick a bunch of high energy batteries in the vehicle we might get more range but then when we try to accelerate they overheat because the rated power is too low and the losses in the system are too high. This causes us to over-engineer the cooling system (adding weight and cost) and we also find that batteries operating at higher temperatures lose capacity faster. Also there are other constraints on the battery design, such as safety, lifetime, weight and last but by no means least cost.\n\nBelow is an indicative spider-plot of the main metrics that battery engineers tend to care about when designing or selecting cells which often compete with one another.\n\n[![](https://github.com/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/raw/main/figures/spider.png)](/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/blob/main/figures/spider.png)\n\nA good intro into cell design can be found at [batterydesign.net](https://www.batterydesign.net/power-versus-energy-cells/)\n. Below is an image taken from that site of the difference between high power and high energy. Thinner electrodes tend to be better for drawing larger currents because there is less material in the way of ion transport but they have more inactive material (i.e. current collectors and separators - the gold, grey and yellow bits) per unit volume making them less energy dense.\n\n[![](https://github.com/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/raw/main/figures/power-vs-energy-cell-b.webp)](/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/blob/main/figures/power-vs-energy-cell-b.webp)\n\nThis problem is even bigger for your buddy designing batteries for electric aircraft as the peak power needed for take-off and landing is much higher (10 x) than the power needed for cruising. So you have to prioritize power and sacrifice range - aircraft also find it really hard to top-up charge mid flight \ud83e\udd23. For great perspectives on the prospects of electric flight and required performance metrics for the battery I recommend [this article](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsenergylett.8b02195)\n and [this article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04139-1)\n.\n\nLuckily you know an engineer at your battery supplier and can call them to discuss the problem.\n\nThe curse of dimensionality\n---------------------------\n\n[](#the-curse-of-dimensionality)\n\nThe battery supplier is well aware of the difficulties in designing batteries and explains they have been spending years on the problem, testing different designs trying to optimize for different use cases. It takes at least 1 day to build and fully test one single design in the lab with all the characterization experiments they need to run and up to 1 month for cells selected for accelerated ageing tests. This is where the cell is cycled really hard constantly and the data collected is then extrapolated to a real-world driving scenario (car mostly parked on your driveway), but going from one scenario to another isn't so straight-forward as the ageing effects are non-linear. A rough estimate for how much it costs to build and test a new battery design on a single cell (one data point) is around $1000.\n\nThat might not sound too much but now consider how many different design decisions go into making one battery. You have to choose materials:\n\n*   Anode\n*   Cathode\n*   Electrolyte\n*   Separator\n\nEach solid material can be tuned by:\n\n*   Thickness\n*   Porosity (amount of space for solid active material or for liquid ion transporting material)\n*   Particle size\n*   Composition if a mixture of materials\n\nThen you have geometric factors like\n\n*   Form factor - cylindrical, prismatic, pouch\n*   Size i.e. 18650\n*   Number of tabs\n*   Current collector thickness\n*   Safety features like venting cap and central mandrel.\n\nEach electrolyte composition can be altered too and this is often where the secret sauce actually is (but maybe more on that another day).\n\nLet's say conservatively there are 20 things you might want to change. If you collect 3 different data points changing each thing one at a time (original design, some number higher, some number lower) whilst keeping everything else constant (usually a good scientific approach) that's 320 possible combinations of changes!\n\nThat's 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3\n\n\\= 3,486,784,401\n\n[![](https://github.com/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/raw/main/figures/counting.gif)](/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/blob/main/figures/counting.gif)\n\nThe short script below illustrates the curse for a 3 variable problem. It's hard to visualize a 20 dimensional parameter space but you get the drift.\n\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\n    import numpy as np\n    \n    def plot_points(x, y, z):\n        # Create a 3D plot\n        fig = plt.figure(figsize=(5, 5))\n        ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')\n    \n        # Plot the points\n        ax.scatter(x.flatten(), y.flatten(), z.flatten(), s=10)\n    \n        # Set titles and labels\n        ax.set_title(f'{np.sum(np.array(np.shape(x)) > 1)}D Parameter Space')\n        ax.set_xlabel('X-axis')\n        ax.set_ylabel('Y-axis')\n        ax.set_zlabel('Z-axis')\n    \n        # Show plot\n        plt.show()\n    \n    # Generate data for 3D space\n    points = np.linspace(0, 1, 10)\n    x, y, z = np.meshgrid(points, 1, 1)\n    plot_points(x, y, z)\n    x, y, z = np.meshgrid(points, points, 1)\n    plot_points(x, y, z)\n    x, y, z = np.meshgrid(points, points, points)\n    plot_points(x, y, z)\n    \n\n[![](https://github.com/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/raw/main/figures/1d-pspace.png)](/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/blob/main/figures/1d-pspace.png)\n [![](https://github.com/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/raw/main/figures/2d-pspace.png)](/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/blob/main/figures/2d-pspace.png)\n [![](https://github.com/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/raw/main/figures/3d-pspace.png)](/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/blob/main/figures/3d-pspace.png)\n\nNow testing 3,486,784,401 batteries is obviously a **ridiculous** thing to do and no reasonable battery developer would carry out that many experiments. Even if you parallelize by say 1000 and have a huge test facility cycling batteries constantly that's still over 1 million experiments for each cycler channel which would take at least 1 million days and cost over $1B dollars!\n\nThis is known as the curse of dimensionality (the more things you have to vary, the **exponentially** more combinations you have to test) and unfortunately battery engineers have this curse pretty bad! In fact several battery unicorns are spending basically all their money on R&D and still trying to bring their new technology to market without having yet put a single cell inside a single car.\n\n[![](https://github.com/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/raw/main/figures/get-out.gif)](/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/blob/main/figures/get-out.gif)\n\nA solution to the \"and\" problem?\n--------------------------------\n\n[](#a-solution-to-the-and-problem)\n\nYour battery cell designer has some hope for your problem though, they have been testing a new material which could deliver more energy density while retaining high power. An anode with a mixture of graphite and silicon. This being silicon valley and all you are pretty excited as there must be plenty of that around and you ask when can you get some batteries to test out....?\n\nWell... your battery supplier says, _\"we're still evaluating that material and it may be a little while longer. The initial tests in the lab look good though and there are already some cells on the market with silicon but they've had a few issues.\"_ More on this in a bit.\n\nTypically, the cell designers won't actually be making all the modifications and carry out all these tests themselves. They will have their own suppliers of materials and they will be doing a lot of the tests too. Let's take the anode as an example:\n\nThe anode is the negative electrode in the cell and hosts ions in what we call the active material (think itty bitty particles). The Li ions intercalate which basically means squeeze inside the crystalline lattice of the host material and this causes the material to change in size. Once inside a process like diffusion occurs where ions migrate to the center of the material (a spherical particle for the sake of argument). As the concentration of Li ions inside the host material changes we call this lithiation i.e. filling up with lithium. This is an electrochemical process and requires electron transfer to take place which occurs when current is supplied or drawn from the cell.\n\nHere's a great and easy to understand video by The Limiting Factor on how batteries work at the particle and atomic level.\n\n[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c723e07f96c61e9a4b99573df420329dd16b35101b16b3d6a3b282183a10d805/68747470733a2f2f696d672e796f75747562652e636f6d2f76692f342d3170734d4853704b732f302e6a7067)](https://youtu.be/4-1psMHSpKs)\n\nAdding silicon to an anode gives more capacity to the cell as there are more host sites for lithium per unit volume but this does have one or two drawbacks. The first is what happens to the cell voltage:\n\n### Voltage Hysteresis\n\n[](#voltage-hysteresis)\n\nThere are typically several stages of the process of lithiation where the crystal structure tends to form stable phases as the degree of lithiation increases or decreases. The chemical potential of the lithiated particles is directly related to the degree of lithiation (hard to measure) and this basically translates to the open circuit potential or voltage of the material (easier to measure).\n\nWithout diving too much deeper into the physics we can safely say, as you charge and discharge, ions move in and out of the host material and voltage changes. The voltage changes more slowly when materials are changing from one stable phase to the next. Careful analysis of the open-circuit potential and it's derivative with respect to lithiation or capacity (dVdQ) can then reveal what the material inside might be because crystals are \"somewhat\" predictable. They have characteristic plateaus in voltage at certain degrees of lithiation. On the flip side: if you know the material you can predict the state of charge (SoC) from the voltage (something the battery systems designers really like to know). I say \"somewhat\" because silicon unfortunately suffers from voltage hysteresis meaning that the voltage when charging and discharging in a cycle follows different paths, even when cycling very slowly, say 1 cycle per day.\n\n[![](https://github.com/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/raw/main/figures/hysteresis.png)](/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/blob/main/figures/hysteresis.png)\n\nIt sounds like a fairly trivial thing to know how much charge your battery has left, why not just measure the current in and out constantly (a technique known as coulomb counting). However, counting is prone to error, if say a sensor fails or has a low accuracy or systematic error the predictions will drift over time. Voltage can be measured and gives an instant snapshot of the state of the battery and is therefore usually used as the indicator of SoC.\n\nBut is voltage reliable? No not really. Voltage has its issues too and depends on how far from equilibrium the system is. Often what happens is the battery is left at rest and then cells connected in parallel start to equalize their open circuit potentials and current re-balances. The overall charge left in the system is still the same but the voltage at rest has relaxed closer to equilibrium compared with when you switched the system off (this also happens inside the cell as well as between cells). Voltage also depends on temperature, ageing, and also whether you are charging or discharging the battery (hysteresis).\n\n### Swelling & Cracking\n\n[](#swelling--cracking)\n\nAnother problem with silicon is that the particles swell to around 80% bigger when lithiated compared to de-lithiated. This is an issue because this causes stress to the particle itself which may break up and no-longer form an active part of the material, and it may also impact its surrounding host material, either breaking that or breaking its connection with it. These mechanical effects cause accelerated ageing of the cell where active material inventory is lost more quickly and cell capacity decreases.\n\n[![](https://github.com/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/raw/main/figures/cracking.jpg)](/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/blob/main/figures/cracking.jpg)\n\nFortunately, making the particles smaller, helps both with the voltage hysteresis and the effects of swelling, it also increases the active surface area per unit mass of the silicon and this helps lower the losses associated with the reactions in the battery.\n\nHow do I know all this you might wonder? Well, there is a certain amount of intuition to these things and I have a PhD and several more years subsequently researching electrochemical systems. But the main reason is that these systems can be explored, tested and evaluated with computational simulations.\n\nPyBaMM to the rescue\n--------------------\n\n[](#pybamm-to-the-rescue)\n\nLet's look at some cool things you can do with simulation to help debug your battery problem. [PyBaMM](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/)\n is open-source and written in Python (that's the **Py** bit). The \"BaMM\" stands for **Ba**ttery **M**athematical **M**odelling.\n\nFirst off, what is going on inside when I charge and discharge and why is my voltage changing the way it does? Which physical processes and their related design features have the biggest effect on the voltage?\n\n    import pybamm\n    model = pybamm.lithium_ion.DFN()\n    parameter_values = pybamm.ParameterValues(\"Chen2020\")\n    experiment = pybamm.Experiment(\n        [\\\n            \"Discharge at 2C for 20 minutes\",\\\n            \"Rest for 10 minutes\",\\\n        ], period=\"30 seconds\"\n    )\n    sim = pybamm.Simulation(model, experiment=experiment, parameter_values=parameter_values)\n    solution = sim.solve()\n    plotter = pybamm.QuickPlot(solutions=solution, time_unit=\"hours\")\n    plotter.dynamic_plot()\n    \n\n[![](https://github.com/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/raw/main/figures/plot.gif)](/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/blob/main/figures/plot.gif)\n\nHere we can clearly see the big difference in voltage when we stop discharging the battery and start resting. But what exactly is going on here? A useful feature of PyBaMM is to split the voltage into its constituent components, known as overpotentials. You have the ideal potential of the battery for a certain state of charge when everything is in equilibrium: the open-circuit potential (OCP) and then you have all the voltage losses associated with things not being at equilibrium.\n\n    pybamm.plot_voltage_components(solution)\n    \n\n[![](https://github.com/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/raw/main/figures/simulation_01_voltage_components.png)](/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/blob/main/figures/simulation_01_voltage_components.png)\n\nHere we can immediately learn a few things:\n\n*   A large portion of the change in voltage of the cell is just the open circuit voltage changing as a function of lithiation (SoC), but other processes are certainly significant.\n*   At the point that the current stops, the voltage relaxes a great deal almost instantly. You can see the green reaction overpotential, purple Ohmic electrolyte potential and brown Ohmic electrode overpotential go from being thick sections to disappearing. This makes sense as these processes are all related to current and ion transport.\n*   The orange and to an extent the red concentration overpotentials are slower to disappear which means that ions are still moving in the system when no reactions are taking place and this is due to the build up of concentration gradients inside the active solid and electrolyte.\n*   The electrolyte losses due to concentration (overpotential) during discharge are fairly sizeable (around 100 mV) but they disappear much faster than within the active material meaning that diffusion is much easier in the electrolyte than within the solid.\n\nWe can inspect the concentration profiles in both solid particles and the electrolyte to confirm these findings. Below are 5 snapshots at the start of the rest period and afterwards.\n\n    plotter = pybamm.QuickPlot(solutions=[solution], output_variables=[\\\n        \"X-averaged negative particle concentration [mol.m-3]\",\\\n        \"X-averaged positive particle concentration [mol.m-3]\",\\\n        \"Electrolyte concentration [mol.m-3]\"\\\n        ])\n    plotter.plot(t=[1200]) # At point of rest\n    plotter.plot(t=[1380])\n    plotter.plot(t=[1800])\n    \n\n[![](https://github.com/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/raw/main/figures/simulation_01_concs_1200.png)](/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/blob/main/figures/simulation_01_concs_1200.png)\n [![](https://github.com/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/raw/main/figures/simulation_01_concs_1380.png)](/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/blob/main/figures/simulation_01_concs_1380.png)\n [![](https://github.com/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/raw/main/figures/simulation_01_concs_1800.png)](/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/blob/main/figures/simulation_01_concs_1800.png)\n\nThe concentration in the positive particle is still not equal as a function of radius. We can intuitively guess then that changing some feature of the positive particle may have some effect on the relaxation behavior of the cell. Let's see what the current positive particle radius is and where changing this value has a significant effect.\n\n    parameter_values[\"Positive particle radius [m]\"]\n    \n\n5.22e-06\n\n    parameter_values[\"Positive particle radius [m]\"] = 3.0e-6\n    sim2 = pybamm.Simulation(model, experiment=experiment, parameter_values=parameter_values)\n    solution2 = sim2.solve()\n    pybamm.plot_voltage_components(solution2)\n    \n\n[![](https://github.com/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/raw/main/figures/simulation_02_voltage_components.png)](/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/blob/main/figures/simulation_02_voltage_components.png)\n\nWe can now see a much faster leveling off of the voltage at rest and we can check the concentrations again\n\n    plotter = pybamm.QuickPlot(solutions=[solution, solution2], labels=[\"Big particle\",\"Small particle\"], output_variables=[\\\n        \"X-averaged negative particle concentration [mol.m-3]\",\\\n        \"X-averaged positive particle concentration [mol.m-3]\",\\\n        \"Electrolyte concentration [mol.m-3]\"\\\n        ])\n    plotter.plot(t=[1200]) # At point of rest\n    plotter.plot(t=[1800]) # At point of rest\n    \n\n[![](https://github.com/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/raw/main/figures/simulation_02_concs_1200.png)](/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/blob/main/figures/simulation_02_concs_1200.png)\n [![](https://github.com/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/raw/main/figures/simulation_02_concs_1800.png)](/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/blob/main/figures/simulation_02_concs_1800.png)\n\nNow the contributions of the positive solid particle to the voltage at rest is resolved much more quickly than before. This is because the smaller particle size allows for faster diffusion of lithium ions in and out of the particle. This is a good example of how the model can be used to investigate the effect of different parameters on the performance of a battery.\n\nThis is just one example of how to use modelling to debug your battery problem. **PyBaMM** also has many other examples including one on modelling [hysteresis](https://docs.pybamm.org/en/stable/source/examples/notebooks/models/differential-capacity-hysteresis-state.html)\n in silicon anodes. Also as we can see here a single experiment takes a matter of seconds and with some of the simpler models only a matter of ms. This helps engineers really battle the curse of dimensionality. For example the Ragone plot below sweeping over some of the common parameters you might investigate changing contains 6500 data points and with each one taking less than 1s running one after the other on a single core would take under 2 hours to compute, already a massive saving compared to weeks with our 1000 channel cycler lab (each experiment takes less than an hour in the lab but we have to prepare the materials and build the cells too). With parallel computing this number can be cut to less than a minute.\n\n[![](https://github.com/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/raw/main/figures/ragone.png)](/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/blob/main/figures/ragone.png)\n\nIf you liked this How to guide and want to learn more about battery modelling head to our github page (and don't forget to give it a \u2b50) [https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM)\n\n[![](https://github.com/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/raw/main/figures/pybamm.png)](/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/blob/main/figures/pybamm.png)\n\nFor enterprises looking to get help with their battery modelling hit me up at [tom@ionworks.com](mailto:tom@ionworks.com)\n or head to our [website](https://www.ionworks.com/)\n\n[![](https://github.com/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/raw/main/figures/ionworks.png)](/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/blob/main/figures/ionworks.png)\n\nAll runnable code in this document can be found [here](/ionworks/how-to-debug-your-battery/blob/main/how-to-debug-your-battery.ipynb)\n\nLinks\n-----\n\n[](#links)\n\n1.

It\u2019s usually only done out of ignorance to better methods by those with little to no formal statistical training.<p>An experiment designed by someone who is well versed in modern experimental design methods would not take billions of runs to optimize\u2014a sequential design that first screens out factors to those that matter (basic Pareto principle) followed by a response surface design or a GP model surrogate to optimize the response would likely be on the order of hundreds (possibly thousands) of runs. This is basic industrial experimentation\u2014see \u201cDesign and Analysis of Experiments\u201d by Douglas C. Montgomery for a nice introductory textbook.\n  - **tomtranter** (): Yes completely agree. This is one of the things that PyBaMM doesn&#x27;t do for you out of the box. I could have extended the article in many ways to cover all the optimizations you could do both with the physical battery or the model. Thanks for sharing the text book. I think my point which I should have stated more clearly was that maybe for smaller design spaces this might not be a bad approach but with batteries the space is huge. I co-authored a paper on optimally reaching the Pareto front using the and problem as an example actually. may be interesting reading for anyone else coming to this area. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0306261921013490\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S03062...</a> Happy to share the pdf with anyone who wants to read the whole thing\n    - **tomtranter** (): Related topic there is this example combining PyBaMM and pints for sensitivity analysis. Which should definitely be done first before delving straight into a DOE <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pints-team&#x2F;electrochem_pde_model\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pints-team&#x2F;electrochem_pde_model</a>\n  - **HPsquared** (): It&#x27;s probably hard to mathematically separate out the different factors in a field like battery design though. I imagine it&#x27;s quite non-linear.\n    - **tylermw** (): Non-linearity is the norm in industrial experimentation :)\n  - **Adams65** (): thanks for sharing...\n- **tra3** (): I\u2019ve been on a journey to learn a bit about battery tech by building my own \u201csolar generator\u201d. Terrible name, but something like a jackery or blue yeti.<p>I acquired 4 lithium iron phosphate cells along with a bms, solar charge controller and various doodads.<p>I had to learn about balancing the cells, wiring, etc. it\u2019s been a bit of a rabbit hole for sure.<p>I ended up building 1.2kwh battery for powering my fridge  and lights while camping. For less than half the price of an equivalent off the shelf unit. Of course it has taken an enormous amount of learning, but that\u2019s free.<p>One the more interesting revelations to me, is how much I under appreciated industrial design before. On the first glance a device like a battery pack is a square box with a couple of outlets but I\u2019ve certainly had a difficult time making it look nice. Internal component wiring is also an interesting challenge.\n  - **schneems** (): My senior design project for mechanical engineering was swapping lead acid batteries in an electric skateboard for nickel metal hydride (2008 lithium battery prices were not within a college budget).<p>It gave me a new found appreciation for battery tech and I still feel a bit like they\u2019re incomprehensible magic boxes.<p>My proudest part of the project was: we didn\u2019t have money for high end voltage or current recording devices and the amps of the thing was quite high. I zip tied a volt meter and an analog current gauge to a piece of plywood, then we mounted a 2x4 at a 90 degree angle and attached a camera to that. We used that setup to take video when we were riding. It let us correlate the time and other units together. By watching the video and manually recording the results into a spreadsheet.<p>Not fast or high precision but it worked well and most importantly was within budget.\n    - **sitkack** (): Now that we have DMMs that have QR code displays you don&#x27;t need to manually transcribe. All joking aside, I have generated telemetry data and displayed via a QR code for exactly this application. Documenting here as prior art so it can&#x27;t be patented.<p>A system and method for displaying time series data from any data-generating device as a Quick Response (QR) code, enabling efficient data extraction from video recordings. This invention facilitates the capture and analysis of time series data without manual transcription across a wide range of applications.\n    - **tomtranter** (): Nice! I love the simple approach like the story which I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s true or not that NASA spent $$$ developing an ink pen that would work in zero-g and the Russians used a pencil.\n    - **barrenko** (): They certainly are magic boxes!\n  - **tomtranter** (): That&#x27;s cool. I&#x27;d love to be able to do that but my hacking skills are somewhat confined to the digital domain. What&#x27;s going to be really interesting in the next few years is the number of batteries coming out of cars which could be re-purposed for grid storage or back-up domestic power like your set-up here. Typically an ev battery is determined to be at end-of-life when it&#x27;s reached 80% of original capacity. However, the capacity is also dependent on how fast you try to cycle it and over what range of SoC. The bigger the SoC window and the faster the cycling the more stress put on the battery and the larger the losses. Taking batteries out of cars and putting them in boxes, cycling them slowly and within a smaller SoC window means you can get a lot more life out of them.\n    - **silisili** (): Thomas Massie, the engineer and arguably overqualified US representative, did just this and made a series of videos about it.  I have no idea if this is the original channel, but it has the updates - part 1 linked below.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qpPYkqpe-Ms\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qpPYkqpe-Ms</a>\n    - **tra3** (): &gt; I&#x27;d love to be able to do that but my hacking skills are somewhat confined to the digital domain.<p>Same for the most part. I&#x27;m venturing into the real world, as it were. Have to have a goal in mind that interests you and then pieces come together.<p>&gt;  batteries coming out of cars<p>So far I&#x27;ve restricted myself to ~12v batteries because I don&#x27;t fully understand the safety procedures required for high voltage applications. Eventually it&#x27;s something I want to get into as well.\n    - **pjc50** (): Hmm. It sounds nice, and people will definitely do it in resource-constrained setups, but I suspect for mass production use nobody wants to touch a EOL pack - all your cost savings are wiped out by the first fire.<p>Not to mention the technological evolution. By the time battery packs manufactured today are EOL, maybe we&#x27;ll have high cycle life solid state sodium batteries coming off the production lines.\n  - **1992spacemovie** (): That&#x27;s so cool - many people wrongly discount the mental benefits of learning the fundamentals of things that already exist as off the shelf products. Batteries and stored energy is an area of electronics (and power) that I haven&#x27;t explored at all beyond off the shelf stuff. Did you happen to keep a blog with your notes and thoughts? I&#x27;d love to read more about it.\n- **SOLAR_FIELDS** (): For those interested in energy profiling tools that have applications for developing battery powered hardware products I can highly recommend Nordic Semiconductor\u2019s PPK II. For a reasonable price you get a hardware tool and software kit that can profile your actual energy usage quite well. It has punched well above its weight on providing power profiles against tools an order of magnitude higher in price. If you are designing a hardware product that runs on battery a tool like this is a necessity.<p>I know above sounds like an advertisement but it isn\u2019t. I\u2019m not affiliated with NS at all. It\u2019s just a great tool and I\u2019m happy to recommend it as there are very few cost effective options in this space.\n  - **Animats** (): That tool is for someone who needs to maximize battery life for a small device.<p>For higher powered DC loads, there are Hall effect sensors. These usually come as plastic-enclosed devices with a hole in them, through which you route one of the high-current wires. They need some DC power, usually 5V or so, and you get a voltage out proportional to the current. They sense the magnetic field from the wire, without requiring a direct connection, which is good when you&#x27;re measuring high current, high voltage, or both. Some have a split ring so you can install the sensor around an existing wire without cutting it.<p>For AC, there are current transformers, which install the same way, and put out a small current in a fixed ratio to the current in the wire being sensed.<p>The hand-held version is a clamp-around AC&#x2F;DC current meter, a common tool.<p>These are all standard, modestly priced items.\n    - **tomtranter** (): I used Hall effect sensors for a project and found they needed a fair bit of calibration. Shunt resistors also did the job with fewer problems but this was a 16p2s module.\n  - **clumsysmurf** (): &gt; Nordic Semiconductor\u2019s PPK II<p>This looks great, from their page:<p>&quot;can measure and optionally supply currents all the way from sub-uA and as high as 1A&quot;<p>Do you have recommendations, for a similar device, that can supply more than 1A?\n    - **buescher** (): It depends on what you need.  But you should start by looking at Keithley&#x27;s SourceMeter &quot;source measure units&quot; and competing instruments from Keysight and Rohde &amp; Schwartz.  There are even specific instruments in this vein that can emulate battery charge&#x2F;discharge models out of the box.  These are typically called &quot;battery simulators&quot; or &quot;battery emulators&quot;.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tek.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;products&#x2F;keithley&#x2F;dc-power-supplies&#x2F;2281s-series-battery-simulator-emulator\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tek.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;products&#x2F;keithley&#x2F;dc-power-supplies&#x2F;2...</a>\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.keysight.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;product&#x2F;E36731A&#x2F;battery-emulator-and-profiler.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.keysight.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;product&#x2F;E36731A&#x2F;battery-emula...</a>\n    - **SOLAR_FIELDS** (): Sorry, I have only developed low current devices and can only speak to applications around those.\n  - **matheusmoreira** (): The folks developing the Sensor Watch also used the Power Profiler Kit II to test its power consumption.

Uber flagged it as fraud because of high usage rates,\u201d Benacci said in an email.\n\nOn Friday, CrowdStrike released a faulty update that rendered around 8.5 million Windows devices unusable, [according to Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/07/20/helping-our-customers-through-the-crowdstrike-outage/)\n. The update caused the affected computers to be stuck at the infamous \u201cblue screen of death,\u201d or BSOD, a bright blue error screen with a message that is shown when Windows crashes or cannot load because of a critical software failure.\n\nThe outage caused delays at airports in Amsterdam, Berlin, Dubai, and London, and [across the United States](https://x.com/US_Stormwatch/status/1814268813879206397)\n. It also caused [several](https://www.beckersspine.com/orthopedic-spine-practices-improving-profits/60138-hospitals-halt-non-urgent-surgeries-amid-global-it-outage.html#:~:text=Hospitals%20across%20the%20U.S.%20postponed,affecting%20computers%20and%20servers%20worldwide.)\n [hospitals](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/two-german-hospitals-cancel-elective-operations-citing-global-it-outage-2024-07-19/)\n to halt surgeries, and paralyzed countless businesses all over the world.\u00a0\n\n#### Contact Us\n\nDo you have more information about the CrowdStrike outage?

In an update on Wednesday, the company said that because of a bug during the process to check that updates are ready to be released to customer devices, the faulty code \u201cpassed validation despite containing problematic content data.\u201d\n\nThe company also published apologies from its CEO George Kurtz, as well as its chief security officer Shawn Henry.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAll of CrowdStrike understands the gravity and impact of the situation,\u201d Kurtz [said in a message](https://www.crowdstrike.com/falcon-content-update-remediation-and-guidance-hub/)\n published on the company\u2019s site. \u201cNothing is more important to me than the trust and confidence that our customers and partners have put into CrowdStrike.

So they asked us to sign a paper to that effect, and gave us each a check for $20.  My thought was that I always assumed the company owned this code, but if they were going to pay for it, then $20 was waaaay too little.  Anyway I took the $20, signed the paper, and got back to work.  But it always gave me a chuckle.\n  - **frognumber** (): Here&#x27;s what I suspect happened:<p>Any contract requires consideration. Without it, it&#x27;s not a valid contract. It doesn&#x27;t require fair consideration, so a clause giving e.g. $1 is typical for many contracts. They were nice and bumped it up to $20.<p>I suspect your work DID belong to the company already, under work-for-hire doctrine, but an explicit contract avoids that ambiguity. Ambiguity can be bad and super-expensive, whether during litigation or even something like an audit. If someone is buying a company, investing, making a major loan, that&#x27;s the kind thing which comes up in due diligence and can be annoying.<p>So I don&#x27;t think they were paying you for the code, so much as trying to come into compliance. Very likely, this was triggered by some similar audit for some deal they were trying to make.\n    - **bityard** (): Interesting. I worked for a company that got bought by another company. Pretty much everyone was a salaried employee with a standard employment contract. There was no formal rehire process, but at some point the new company did the same thing as OP&#x27;s company, saying that anything we produce at work or with work resources belongs to the company. But with an added &quot;no moonlighting&quot; clause.<p>We did not get any consideration, cash, or gift cards. Instead we were told that if we didn&#x27;t sign the new company&#x27;s mandatory agreements, our employment status could be up for review.\n    - **chimeracoder** (): That&#x27;s exactly it. The $20 is not an assessed value of the code; it&#x27;s to establish consideration. $1 would have been legal. It&#x27;s legal to make <i>asymmetric</i> contracts that benefit one party more than the other, just not contracts that are <i>completely</i> one-sided. They probably did $20 just so it wouldn&#x27;t seem quite as insulting.<p>Anytime you see stories of &quot;[insert name of rich CEO or politician] takes salary of only $1&quot;, that&#x27;s why. They can&#x27;t work literally for free, or the rest of the contract becomes nonbinding.\n    - **creer** (): Watch out for &quot;work-for-hire doctrine&quot; erm... assumptions.<p>Last time I looked work-for-hire law only takes effect if there is explicit mention of the term &quot;work-for-hire&quot; in the contract, otherwise it&#x27;s not &quot;work-for-hire&quot;.

But before diving into this both old yet new idea, let\u2019s briefly revisit what branch predictors do and why they\u2019re so critical in modern microprocessor cores.\n\nEver since computers began operating on programs stored in programmable, randomly accessible memory, architectures have been split into a front end that fetches instructions and a back end responsible for performing those operations. A front end must also support arbitrarily moving the point of current program execution to allow basic functionality like conditional evaluation, looping, and subroutines.\n\nIf a processor could simply perform the entire task of fetching an instruction, executing it, and selecting the next instruction location in unison, there would be little else to discuss here. However, incessant demands for performance have dictated that processors perform more operations in the same unit time with the same amount of circuitry, taking us from 5 kHz with ENIAC to the 5+ GHz of some contemporary CPUs like Zen 5, and this has necessitated pipelined logic. A processor must actually maintain in parallel the incrementally completed partial states of logically chronologically distinct operations.\n\nKeeping this pipeline filled is immediately challenged by the existence of conditional jumping within a program. How can the front end know what instructions to begin fetching, decoding, and dispatching when a jump\u2019s condition might be a substantial number of clock cycles away from finishing evaluation? Even unconditional jumps with a statically known target address present a problem when fetching and decoding an instruction needs more than a single pipeline stage.\n\nThe two ultimate responses of this problem are to either simply wait when the need is detected or to make a best effort guess at what to do next and be able to unwind discovered mistakes. Unwinding bad guesses must be done by flushing the pipeline of work contingent on the bad guess and restarting at the last known good point. A stall taken on a branch condition is effectively unmitigable and proportional in size to the number of stages between the instruction fetch and the branch condition evaluation completion in the pipeline. Given this and the competitive pressures to not waste throughput, processors have little choice but to attempt guessing program instruction sequences as accurately as possible.\n\nImagine for a moment that you are a delivery driver without a map or GPS who must listen to on-the-fly navigation from colleagues in the back of the truck. Now further imagine that your windows are completely blacked out and that your buddies only tell you when you were supposed to turn 45 seconds past the intersection you couldn\u2019t even see. You can start to empathize and begin to understand the struggles of the instruction fetcher in a pipelined processor. The art of branch prediction is the universe of strategies that are available to reduce the rate that this woefully afflicted driver has to stop and back up.\n\nNaive strategies like always taking short backwards jumps (turning on to a circular drive) can and historically did provide substantial benefit over always fetching the next largest instruction memory address (just keep driving straight). However, if some small amount of state is allowed to be maintained, much better results in real programs can be achieved. If the blinded truck analogy hasn\u2019t worn too thin yet, imagine the driver keeping a small set of notes of recent turns taken or skipped and hand-drawn scribbles of how roads driven in the last few minutes were arranged and what intersections were passed. These are equivalent to things like branch history and address records, and structures in the 10s of kilobytes have yielded branch prediction percentages in the upper 90s. This article will not attempt to cover the enormous space of research and commercial solutions here, but understanding at least the beginnings of the motivations here is valuable.\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/chipsandcheese.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-5-1.jpg?resize=688%2C330&ssl=1)\n\nAnnotated floorplan from AMD\u2019s 2023 ISSCC presentation: _\u201cZen 4\u201d \u2013 The AMD 5nm 5.7 GHz x86-64 Microprocessor Core_. The front end takes half of all total L1 cache and integer logic area, and the branch predictor logic and state received the largest area budget of any front end subsystem.\n\nEnter stage right, Zen 5\u2019s 2-Ahead Branch Predictor.\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/chipsandcheese.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Zen5-front-end.drawio.png?resize=688%2C390&ssl=1)\n\nDiagram of Zen 5\u2019s Front End\n\nThe 2-Ahead Branch Predictor is a proposal that dates back to the early \u201990s. Even back then the challenge of scaling out architectural widths of 8 or more was being talked about and a 2-Ahead Branch Predictor was one of the methods that academia put forth in order to continue squeezing more and more performance out of a single core.\u00a0\n\nBut as commercial vendors moved from a single core CPU to multi-core CPUs, the size of each individual core started to become a bigger and bigger factor in CPU core design so academia started focusing on more area efficient methods to increase performance with the biggest development being the TAGE predictor. The TAGE predictor is much more area efficient compared to older branch predicting methods so again academia focused on improving TAGE predictors.\n\nBut with logic nodes allowing for more and more transistors in a similar area along with moving from dual and quad core CPUs to CPUs with hundreds of out of order CPUs, we have started to focus more and more on single core performance rather than just scaling further and further up. So while some of these ideas are quite old, older than I in fact, they are starting to resurface as companies try and figure out ways to increase the performance of a single core.\n\nIt is worth addressing an aspect of x86 that allows it to benefit disproportionately more from 2-ahead branch prediction than some other ISAs might. Architectures with fixed-length instructions, like 64-bit Arm, can trivially decode arbitrary subsets of an instruction cache line in parallel by simply replicating decoder logic and slicing up the input data along guaranteed instruction byte boundaries. On the far opposite end of the spectrum sits x86, which requires parsing instruction bytes linearly to determine where each subsequent instruction boundary lies. Pipelining (usually partially decoding length-determining prefixes first) makes a parallelization of some degree tractable, if not cheap, which resulted in 4-wide decoding being commonplace in performance-oriented x86 cores for numerous years.\n\nWhile increasing logic density with newer fab nodes has eventually made solutions like Golden Cove\u2019s 6-wide decoding commercially viable, the area and power costs of monolithic parallel x86 decoding are most definitely super-linear with width, and there is not anything resembling an easy path forward with continued expansions here. It is perhaps merciful for Intel and AMD that typical application integer code has a substantial branch density, on the order of one every five to six instructions, which diminishes the motivation to pursue parallelized decoders much wider than that.\n\nThe escape valve that x86 front ends need more than anything is for the inherently non-parallelizable portion of decoding, i.e., the determination of the instruction boundaries. If only there was some way to easily skip ahead in the decoding and be magically guaranteed you landed on an even instruction boundary\u2026\n\n### Back to the Future!\u2026. of the 1990s\n\nStarting with the paper titled [\u201cMultiple-block ahead branch predictors\u201d by Seznec et al.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/237090.237169)\n, it lays out the why and how of the reasoning and implementation needed to make a 2-Ahead Branch Predictor.\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/chipsandcheese.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-3.png?resize=688%2C422&ssl=1)\n\nFigure 4a from Seznac et al. showing how a 2-Ahead Branch Predictor with a double instruction fetch pipeline would be able to predict 2 basic blocks\n\nLooking into the paper, you\u2019ll see that implementing a branch predictor that can deal with multiple taken branches per cycle is not as simple as just having a branch predictor that can deal with multiple taken branches. To be able to use a 2-Ahead Branch Predictor to its fullest, without exploding area requirements, Seznac et al. recommended dual-porting the instruction fetch.\n\nWhen we look at Zen 5, we see that dual porting the instruction fetch and the op cache is exactly what AMD has done. AMD now has two 32 Byte per cycle fetch pipes from the 32KB L1 instruction cache, each feeding its own 4-wide decode cluster. The Op Cache is now a dual-ported 6 wide design which can feed up to 12 operands to the Op Queue.\n\nNow, Seznac et al. also recommends dual porting the Branch Target Buffer (BTB). A dual-ported L1 BTB could explain the massive 16K entries that the L1 BTB has access to. As for the L2 BTB, it\u2019s not quite as big as the L1 BTB at only 8K entries but AMD is using it in a manner similar to how a victim cache would be used. So entries that get evicted out of the L1 BTB, end up in the L2 BTB.\n\nWith all these changes, Zen 5 can now deal with 2 taken branches per cycle across a non-contiguous block of instructions.\u00a0\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/chipsandcheese.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-4.png?resize=688%2C143&ssl=1)\n\nFigure 3 from Seznac et al. showing the branch information for a 2-Ahead predictor\n\nThis should reduce the hit to fetch bandwidth when Zen 5 hits a taken branch as well as allowing AMD to predict past the 2 taken branches.\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/chipsandcheese.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-4.jpg?resize=688%2C387&ssl=1)\n\nSlide 6 from AMD\u2019s Deep Dive brief into the Zen 5 architecture\n\nZen 5 can look farther forward in the instruction stream beyond the 2nd taken branch and as a result Zen 5 can have 3 prediction windows where all 3 windows are useful in producing instructions for decoding. The way that this works is that a 5 bit length field is attached to the 2nd prediction window which prevents the over subscription of the decode or op cache resources. This 5 bit length field while smaller than a pointer does give you the start of the 3rd prediction window. One benefit of this is that if the 3rd window crosses a cache line boundary, the prediction lookup index doesn\u2019t need to store extra state for the next cycle. However a drawback is that if the 3rd prediction window is in the same cache line as the 1st or 2nd prediction window, that partial 3rd window isn\u2019t as effective as having a 3rd full prediction window.\n\nNow when Zen 5 has two threads active, the decode clusters and the accompanying fetch pipes are statically partitioned. This means that to act like a dual fetch core, Zen 5 will have to fetch out of both the L1 instruction cache as well as out of the Op Cache. This maybe the reason why AMD dual-ported the op cache so that they can better insure that they can keep the dual fetch pipeline going.\n\n### Final Words\n\nIn the end, this new 2-Ahead Branch Predictor is a major shift for the Zen family of CPU architectures moving forward and is going to give new branch prediction capabilities that will likely serve the future developments of the Zen core in good stead as they refine and improve this branch predictor.\n\nIf you like our articles and journalism, and you want to support us in our endeavors, then consider heading over to our\u00a0[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ChipsandCheese)\n\u00a0or our\u00a0[PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=4EMPH66SBGVSQ)\n\u00a0if you want to toss a few bucks our way.

With Zen5c we get 192 Core or 384vCPU. We should be getting 256 Core with Zen 6c next year. Which means on a Dual Socket 1U Server, that is a potential of 512 Core with 1024 vCPU.<p>Whatever Web App Scaling issues we had in 2014 could now fit into a single server, assuming we somehow manage to cool the thing. Even at 1 RPS per vCPU that is 1000 RPS, excluding cache hit. Even on HN front-page dont hit the server at 1000 Page View per second.\n  - **bayindirh** (): Serving web pages is cheap. You\u2019ll probably hit network I&#x2F;O limits before you saturate the cores.<p>I wonder what about its HPC performance. I think cooling this won\u2019t be big problem, but might be wet one, requiring DLC after a certain point.\n    - **Dylan16807** (): &gt; Serving web pages is cheap. You\u2019ll probably hit network I&#x2F;O limits before you saturate the cores.<p>It&#x27;s hard to be network I&#x2F;O bound when serving web pages.  Netflix struggles to be network I&#x2F;O bound when serving <i>video</i>, which is so much bigger and uses so much less processing.<p>Epyc started off with 32 cores on PCIe 3, and quickly moved to 64 cores on PCIe 4.  When we hit 256 cores it&#x27;s probably going to have PCIe 6, which means it&#x27;s still the same I&#x2F;O per core.<p>But those numbers are crazy overkill for web serving anyway.  If you wanted to allocate about a gigabit per core, with 512 cores across two CPUs, using PCIe 5 to be conservative, you&#x27;d need at total of... 16 lanes, for a single 400gb&#x2F;s card you can buy today.<p>(This is assuming you mean the I&#x2F;O from the server to the network.  If you&#x27;re talking about I&#x2F;O outside the server, then upgrade your switches.  Using denser servers doesn&#x27;t increase your network load, it lets you take the same load and send it to fewer racks.  You&#x27;re already handling the total data <i>somewhere</i>.)\n    - **touisteur** (): As for zen3 and zen4, it&#x27;s been a pleasure to work with good vectorization perf, and it seems they&#x27;ve been doing avx512 &#x27;right&#x27;, at least for HPC I know.<p>Add to that the 12 channels of DDR per socket and the quite generous cache, and once you&#x27;ve swallowed the need to buy 24 sticks for 2 sockets, these things are beautiful beasts, at what Intel has taught us, a very reasonable price (ask you OEM for prices, public prices on CPUs are nuts).\n    - **JonChesterfield** (): Lots of water in data centers these days. Works fine. I think the fear about that lost to the utility some years ago.\n  - **WithinReason** (): The opposite might be true, the better you are at utilising the CPU pipeline the less space you have to run a 2nd thread so SMT&#x27;s benefits might diminish\n    - **ColonelPhantom** (): Correct. However, Zen 5 seems to be the first major &#x27;scaling up&#x27; that AMD has done since the original Zen, given that the core seems to be moving from dispatching 6 to 8 instructions per clock and 4 to 6 ALUs. I would expect that SMT to be excellent for low-IPC workloads to get the most out of that scaling.\n  - **fulafel** (): SMT could use a lot more benchmarking investigations.<p>Intuitively having more tasks working on the same problem at half speed should have a memory usage cost, are apps commonly using more memory for no speed gain when using SMT?<p>In a lot of published benchmarks it seems most apps don&#x27;t noticeably benefit in executions peed.\n    - **crest** (): SMT also allows the cores to hide memory latency by executing the other thread(s). Taken to the extreme end this would give you a barrel CPU.\n- **IvanAchlaqullah** (): It&#x27;s always interesting to see decades old papers, sometimes published with little to no fanfares, suddenly becomes &quot;state of the art&quot; because hardware have become powerful enough.<p>For example Z-buffers[1].

Single core performance was stifled in the last 2 decades by prioritizing horizontal scaling (more cores), thus the complexity &#x2F; die area of each individual core became a concern. I imagine if this trend did not take place for some reason, and the CPU designers primarily pursued single core performance, we&#x27;d see implementation much sooner.<p>Regarding the Z-buffer, I kind of get that this would appear as a side note, it&#x27;s a simple concept. Perhaps even better example is ray tracing - the concept is even quite obvious to people without 3D graphics background, but it was just impractical (for real-time rendering) in terms of performance until recently. What I find interesting is that we haven&#x27;t found a simpler approach to approximate true to life rendering and need to fallback on this old, sort of naive (and expensive) solution.\n"}]}

It allows you to update your DNS records on Cloudflare automatically using a free Cloudflare account and a cronjob on your computer.\n\nSetup\n-----\n\n[](#setup)\n\n1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.\n    \n2.  Create a `keys.json` file in the `~/.cloudflare-noip/` directory with the following structure:\n    \n\n```json\n{\n    \"api_key\": \"your_cloudflare_api_key\",\n    \"email\": \"your_cloudflare_email\",\n    \"zone_id\": \"your_cloudflare_zone_id\"\n}\n```\n\nTo get your Cloudflare API key and zone ID:\n\n*   Log in to your Cloudflare account and go to the \"My Profile\" section.\n*   Click on \"API Tokens\" and create a new token with the \"Zone\" permission.\n*   Copy the API key and zone ID from the token details.\n\n3.  Create a `records.json` file in the `~/.cloudflare-noip/` directory with the following structure:\n\n```json\n[\\\n\t{\\\n        \"record_name\": \"sub.domain.xyz\",\\\n        \"record_type\": \"A\",\\\n        \"proxied\": true\\\n\t},\\\n\t{\\\n\t...\\\n\t}\\\n]\n```\n\nThe `content` field will be automatically updated with the IP address of the machine running the script.\n\n4.  Set up a cronjob to run the script at the desired interval. Here are examples for Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows:\n\n**Ubuntu/Debian:**\n\n```shell\ncrontab -e\n```\n\nAdd the following line to run the script every minute: (one HN user rightly pointed out that since it's a home server 1 minute update is more appropriate; this frequency is your max downtime.)\n\n```shell\n*/1 * * * * cd /path/to/cloudflare-noip && /usr/bin/python3 main.py\n```\n\nrestart cron (optional)\n\n```shell\nsudo systemctl restart cron\n```\n\n**macOS (using launchd):**\n\n1.  Create a new file in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` called `com.example.cloudflare-noip.plist` with the following contents:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n\t<key>Label</key>\n\t<string>com.example.cloudflare-noip</string>\n\t<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n\t<array>\n\t\t<string>/usr/bin/python3</string>\n\t\t<string>/Users/d/Projects/cloudflare-noip/main.py</string>\n\t</array>\n\t<key>StartInterval</key>\n\t<integer>60</integer>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n```\n\n2.  Load the launch agent:\n\n```shell\nlaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.example.cloudflare-noip.plist\n```\n\n**Windows (using Task Scheduler):**\n\n1.  Open the Task Scheduler: Press the Windows key + R, type `taskschd.msc`, and press Enter.\n2.  Create a new task:\n    *   General: Give the task a name and description.\n    *   Triggers: Create a new trigger with the desired interval (e.g., every minute).\n    *   Actions: Create a new action to start a program: `python.exe` with the argument `/path/to/cloudflare_noip.py`.\n    *   Conditions: Set any additional conditions as needed.\n3.  Save the task.\n\nThe script will update the DNS records on Cloudflare with the current IP address of the machine running the script at the specified interval.\n\nAbout\n-----\n\nfree alternative to paid dynamic DNS services like NoIP.com\n\n### Resources\n\n[Readme](#readme-ov-file)\n\n### License\n\n[MIT license](#MIT-1-ov-file)\n\n[Activity](/devrim/cloudflare-noip/activity)\n\n### Stars\n\n[**505** stars](/devrim/cloudflare-noip/stargazers)\n\n### Watchers\n\n[**3** watching](/devrim/cloudflare-noip/watchers)\n\n### Forks\n\n[**8** forks](/devrim/cloudflare-noip/forks)\n\n[Report repository](/contact/report-content?content_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdevrim%2Fcloudflare-noip&report=devrim+%28user%29)\n\n[Releases](/devrim/cloudflare-noip/releases)\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nNo releases published\n\n[Packages 0](/users/devrim/packages?repo_name=cloudflare-noip)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo packages published  \n\n[Contributors 2](/devrim/cloudflare-noip/graphs/contributors)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*    [![@devrim](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/203507?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/devrim)\n    [**devrim** Devrim Yasar](https://github.com/devrim)\n    \n*    [![@taoeffect](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/138706?s=64&v=4)](https://github.com/taoeffect)\n    [**taoeffect** Greg Slepak](https://github.com/taoeffect)\n    \n\nLanguages\n---------\n\n*   [Python 100.0%](/devrim/cloudflare-noip/search?l=python)\n    \n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n-----\nGenerate comments in a hierarchical structure with 3 comments per level, up to a depth of 3."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n- **kurokawad** (): Very cool!

Provide thoughtful and diverse comments that might appear on a tech-focused news site."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please generate a comment section for the following article:\n\nTitle: Bayesian Statistics: The three cultures\n\nURL: https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/07/10/three-cultures-bayes-subjective-objective-pragmatic/\n\nContent: [Skip to primary content](#content)\n\n**Subjective Bayes**\n\nA traditional subjective Bayesian will assume a data generating distribution (aka a likelihood when viewed as a function of the parameters). Then, conditional on this assumption, they encode their prior beliefs as a prior distribution over parameters. After this, they turn the crank on posterior inference and don\u2019t look back.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if anyone ever followed this philosophy strictly, nor do I know if anyone would register their affiliation as subjective Bayesian these days.\n\n**Objective Bayes**\n\nI believe the so-called \u201cobjective Bayes\u201d philosophy stems from a combination of wanting to do hypothesis testing (perhaps using Bayes factors) and deeply feeling what Andrew calls the \u201c[Bayesian cringe](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2021/09/15/the-bayesian-cringe/)\n.\u201d To quote from a paper by one of its leading proponents (my highlights),\n\n> Reference analysis produces objective Bayesian inference, in the sense that inferential statements depend only on the **assumed model** and the available data, and the prior distribution used to make an inference is **least informative** in a certain information-theoretic sense.\n> \n> In: Berger, Bernardo and Sun. 2009. The formal definiton of reference priors.\n\nThere are still lots of folks characterizing (at least some of) their work this way judging from the fact that they run conferences, publish books with \u201cobjective Bayes\u201d in the title, etc. It\u2019s in some sense behind the wide gamma(epsilon, epsilon) and normal(0, 10\\_000) priors employed in the BUGS examples.\n\n**Pragmatic Bayes**\n\nAndrew follows a philosophy that I call \u201cpragmatic Bayes.\u201d It\u2019s laid out crisply in the first edition of Gelman, Carlin, Stern, and Rubin\u2019s book [_Bayesian Data Analysis_](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/)\n, the second paragraph of which begins as follows (my highlights).\n\n> The process of Bayesian data analysis can be idealized by dividing it into the following three steps:\n> \n> 1.  Setting up a full **probability model\u2014a joint probability distribution** for all observable and unobservable quantities in a problem. The model should be consistent with **knowledge about the underlying scientific problem and the data collection process**.\n> 2.  Conditioning on observed data: calculating and interpreting the appropriate posterior distribution\u2014the conditional probability distribution of the unobserved quantities of ul- timate interest, given the observed data.\n> 3.  Evaluating the fit of the model and the implications of the resulting posterior distribution: how well does the model fit the data, are the substantive conclusions reasonable, and how sensitive are the results to the modeling assumptions in step 1? In response, **one can alter or expand the model and repeat the three steps**.\n\nFirst, the probability model is joint, which means it includes the prior and the likelihood. Second, it characterizes our inputs as \u201cknowledge\u201d rather than \u201cbelief.\u201d Third, it encourages practitioners to evaluate how well a model fits and its predictive consequences, and if there are issues, go back and try again. This process is what Andrew finally branded as \u201cworkflow.\u201d\n\n**Standard operating procedure in engineering**\n\nThis is standard operating procedure in engineering, where it is simply called [\u201citerative design\u201d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_design)\n . It\u2019s the way almost all machine learning is done. Coming from a CS and ML background, I was shocked to learn that statisticians didn\u2019t think this way.\n\n**Postscript on the strategy behind _BDA_**\n\nAndrew told me he made the explicit decision early on when writing the first edition of _BDA_ to skip the philosophy and just \u201cdo\u201d science. He and Rubin never characterized their iterative design process with a name.\n\nI think that\u2019s a wise choice, because it\u2019s hard to characterize other peoples\u2019 philosophical beliefs accurately and even harder to change them through debate. Or as editors like to tell writers, \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell.\u201d Or as I used to say back when I worked on linguistics and philosophy, if your scientific method needs a philosophy of science disclaimer, it\u2019s probably not very convincing science.\n\n**Post2script on likelihood vs. prior**\n\nAlthough some of this discussion is about approaches to priors, I agree with Andrew that the choice of prior is no more or less \u201csubjective\u201d than the choice of likelihood. Andrew summed this up neatly in his post, [\u201cStraining on the gnat of the prior distribution while swallowing the camel that is the likelihood\u201d](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/04/27/straining-on-the-gnat-of-the-prior-distribution-while-swallowing-the-camel-that-is-the-likelihood-econometrics-edition/)\n .\n\n**Post3sript on belief vs. knowledge**\n\nFrom a philosophical perspective, I prefer a more epistemological characterization of priors and likelihoods in terms of \u201cknowledge\u201d rather than a doxastic characterization in terms of \u201cbelief\u201d. This is the framing originally provided by Laplace and later explored more thoroughly by John Stuart Mill and followed by Gelman et al. in _BDA_.\n\n**Post4script on etymology behind this post**\n\nIn 1959, C.P. Snow wrote what became a famous essay on the arts vs. sciences, titled \u201cThe two cultures.\u201d In 2001, L. Breiman wrote an influential essay, titled \u201cStatistical modeling: the two cultures.\u201d \\[edit: Thanks for correct citation, Ben.\\] Breiman\u2019s contrast is about the distinction between modeling a generative process explicitly versus using a very flexible model (\u201chigh capacity\u201d in ML speak). Breiman championed decision forests in his work, and his approach is still winning Kaggle contests where there\u2019s not enough data to fit a state-of-the-art neural network.\n\nI wonder if Andrew considers decision forests and neural networks to be examples of what he called \u201cthe unfolding flower,\u201d for example [in this post](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/11/13/multilevel-models-for-taxonomic-data-structures/)\n.\n\n56 thoughts on \u201cBayesian statistics: the three cultures\u201d\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.  Bob:\n    \n    Regarding the Breiman paper that you mention, I wrote [a discussion of it a few years ago](http://stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/gelman_breiman.pdf)\n     for the journal Observational Studies. In that discussion, I listed some points where I agreed with Breiman and some points where I disagreed, and then I concluded:\n    \n    > Breiman\u2019s insights into meta-statistics as well as his statistical ideas remain relevant today. His anti-Bayesianism was a blind spot but it should not have much effect on now we read his article on the two cultures, once we recognize that hierarchical Bayes can be viewed as an example of his preferred approach.\n    > \n    > I will conclude by listing three ways that we can apply Breiman\u2019s algorithmic perspective to current problems in statistics.\n    > \n    > First is the problem of taking inference from existing data and generalizing to a new predictive problem. This is a central task of statistics and arises even with the cleanest experimental and survey data, as we are almost always interested in applying our findings to new cases and new scenarios. In such problems we should respect Breiman\u2019s dictum that the data mechanism is unknown\u2014indeed, in these problems of generalization there is typically no \u201cdata mechanism\u201d at all. I think the concept of \u201cthe data mechanism\u201d is itself a holdover from traditional theoretical statistics. We can apply hierarchical modeling to regularize our predictions and apply cross-validation to evaluate them, and new challenges arise when cross-validating structured rather than independently distributed data.\n    > \n    > Second is the problem of model checking. Once we accept that our models are only approximations, this does not mean we can give up or relax into nihilism. By seeing how our models don\u2019t fit the data, and where in data space this is happening, we can build better models and make better predictions. Models, being imperfect, are works in progress.\n    > \n    > Third is the problem of black-box computing. Random forests, hierarchical Bayes, and deep learning all have in common that they can be difficult to understand (although, as Breiman notes, purportedly straightforward models such as logistic regression are not so easy to understand either, in practical settings with multiple predictors) and are fit by big computer programs that act for users as black boxes. Anyone who has worked with a black-box fitting algorithm will know the feeling of wanting to open up the box and improve the fit: these procedures often do this thing where they give the \u201cwrong\u201d answer, but it\u2019s hard to guide the fit to where you want it to go. There is a tension between Stern\u2019s principles of model checking, model improvement, and using more data, and the black-box feel of modern predictive models.\n    > \n    > All this is to say that we have a lot more work to do, and seeing the strengths and weaknesses of Breiman\u2019s arguments may point us in some helpful directions.\n    \n    [Reply \u2193](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/07/10/three-cultures-bayes-subjective-objective-pragmatic/?replytocom=2375345#respond)\n    \n2.  Bob:\n    \n    Also regarding the title of your post, there\u2019s a famous paper by I. J. Good on the 40,000+ varieties of Bayesians. I personally find that paper kind of annoying, because, if you slice the salami in as many directions as Good does in that article, you could find 40,000+ varieties of frequentists, or 40,000+ varieties of political scientists, or 40,000+ varieties of cognitive psychologists, or whatever. I don\u2019t think Bayesians are more fractious than other subfields.\n    \n    Finally, regarding subjectivity and objectivity, I recommend [this paper with Hennig](http://stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/gelman_hennig_full_discussion.pdf)\n    , \u201cBeyond subjective and objective in statistics.\u201d\n    \n    [Reply \u2193](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/07/10/three-cultures-bayes-subjective-objective-pragmatic/?replytocom=2375353#respond)\n    \n    *   Although Good thought there were many types of Bayesians, he consistently provided a unifying definition of a Bayesian, such as this one from the paper you mention: \u201cAll Bayesians, as I understand the term, believe that it is usually meaningful to talk about the probability of a hypothesis and they make some attempt to be consistent in their judgements.\u201d Or this example from his 1965 book: \u201cSeveral different kinds of Bayesians exist, but it seems to me that the essential defining property of a Bayesian is that they regard it as meaningful to talk about the probability P(H|E) of a hypothesis H, given evidence E.\u201d Or this one from another paper: \u201cThe essence of the Bayesian method, in all its forms, is that it assumes that probabilities of hypotheses are meaningful enough, either as credibilities or as subjective probabilities.\u201d\n        \n        I guess I\u2019m trying to say that although he may have been interested in the intricacies of his Doogian philosophy, he also focused mostly on defending the heart of the Bayesian approach. I think this quote from his 1950 book strikes at the core of the issue from his point of view: \u201cObjections have frequently been raised against Bayes\u2019 theorem on the grounds that the initial probabilities of the hypotheses cannot be estimated, or that they do not exist. The view held here is that the initial probabilities may always be assumed to exist within the abstract theory, but in some cases you may be able to judge only that they lie in rather wide intervals. This does not prevent the application of Bayes\u2019 theorem: it merely makes it less effective than if the intervals are narrow. It is hardly satisfactory to say that the probabilities do not exist when the intervals are wide, while admitting that they do exist when the intervals are narrow.\u201d\n        \n        [Reply \u2193](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/07/10/three-cultures-bayes-subjective-objective-pragmatic/?replytocom=2375614#respond)\n        \n3.

Related: I am reading a pop-sci book on Bayes (optimistically titled Everything is Predictable) and there it says that someone claimed that there is not a single Bayesian who uses informative priors from previous data. I was really surprised to read that, because at least I do that all the time, and I would have thought that others do that routinely. Maybe the prevalence/dominance of \u201cobjective Bayes\u201d makes that line of work less prominent? Not sure why anyone would accuse Bayesians of not using prior information.

I think he gets annoyed by bad examples of Bayesian statistics and he thinks that significance testing is better than the alternative. Maybe he\u2019ll read the above post and agree with us that cost-benefit analysis is not the same thing as significance thresholding. I\u2019m not trying to convince him to use my statistical methods; I\u2019d just like him to be more clear on the differences between these different approaches.\n                \n                Also, yeah, it would be good for him to recognize that applied researchers do use priors informed by past data. To be fair, the analyses in my books and published papers mostly have used weak priors, and lots of other Bayesian writing on informative priors doesn\u2019t use applied examples, so I can see how someone from the outside such as Lakens could get the impression that informative priors never get used. One way my thinking has changed over the past several years is that I\u2019ve become much more comfortable with informative priors.\n                \n            *   Daniel Lakeland, in fact one of my former postdocs keeps confusing your name and Lakens\u2019. Once they said to me that Lakens said such and such on Gelman\u2019s blog and I said, that\u2019s impossible. Turns out it was you.\n                \n                So what Lakens is all about, based on the quotes in the book, is that he thinks that there is no room for dogma in scientific inference. By dogma he seems to mean the introduction of priors into a model. It looks like he has never done any serious Bayesian modeling (probably he\u2019s fired up JASP and run some analyses), so he thinks (I think) that priors have a biasing function.\n                \n                To quote Lakens: \u201cMy evaluation of the data is not based on my priors.\u201d (P 102 of the book). He goes on to say that the p-value stands for itself (SV note: Type M error be damned). He says: \u201cYou don\u2019t believe in the Higgs boson because you had a prior, you saw data and you updated it\u201d (\u201cit\u201d is probably one\u2019s belief).\n                \n                \u201cThey did two five-sigma tests\u2026 Either the result is true, or we live in the only one out of 11 million universes where we get this level of data\u201d (SV: he means statistic not data) \u201cby fluke\u201d.\n                \n                He wants to lower the alpha instead of using priors.\n                \n                My personal position: Actually, if one is committed to frequentist tools (say, due to technical incompetence or innumeracy or sheer laziness or inertia or even philosophical reasons), then I would be OK with lowering the alpha to say 0.0001 and demonstrating that the effect replicates in a direct replication attempt. So each study should demonstrate the effect twice, each with alpha set to 0.0001. I\u2019d actually be OK with that. However, if the second replication is not significant, I would have to conclude that my results are not conclusive. And please, none of that marginal significant stuff.\n                \n                Daniel Lakeland, you should probably watch Lakens\u2019 Coursera course (I haven\u2019t). There he spells out how he thinks frequentist stats works in an idiot-proof manner (I am told). Please mastodon about it if you do so I can find out what it\u2019s really like.\n                \n            *   Thanks, Shravan, will take a look.\n                \n            *   Shravan,\n                \n                I just don\u2019t have the time to watch his videos on Coursera, I\u2019d much better spend that time watching videos from the JuliaCon 2024.\n                \n                I have read some of the book he puts out and I think it\u2019s for the Coursera course [https://lakens.github.io/statistical\\_inferences/](https://lakens.github.io/statistical_inferences/)\n                \n                It seems more or less standard Frequentist stuff\u2026 my biggest problem with Frequentist stuff is it makes an objectionable assumption that repeatedly performing an experiment is mathematically equivalent from sampling from a random sequence.\n                \n                This is equivalent to a strong statement about the Kolmogorov Complexity of data coming out of your experiment. The difference between \u201cI don\u2019t know better than p(x) what the next x value will be\u201d and \u201cthe universe conspires so that in repeated sampling the long term frequency of X=x is p(x)\u201d are two completely different views of the physics of the world. Only one of them is compatible with the known facts about the world. Sometimes the frequentist viewpoint is an acceptable substitute for the \u201cphysics\u201d (or more generally mechanistic description of a process) but that\u2019s an assumption that should in general be tested by collecting a large sample of things.\n                \n                So if you\u2019re planning to do Frequentist statistics because you have a plethora of thousands and thousands of data points collected in a stable experimental manner and these pass at least some basic tests for randomness\u2026 then I say more power to you. This is vastly less than 1% of most science.\n                \n            *   Shravan:\n                \n                That\u2019s a great summary, and it shows the strength of Lakens\u2019s position.\n                \n                There are some problems where you can get a lot of data, get your p-value down to 0.0001, conduct replication studies at different labs, and really establish the existence, sign, and stability of your effect. For example, if you\u2019re a psychologist studying something like the Stroop effect. Or in some experiments in physics, chemistry, and biology. For that sort of problem, there\u2019s an appeal of the classical approach. I still think the null-hypothesis framing is not quite right\u2014ultimately, I think we are interested not in rejecting nulls but in estimating effects and determining that they are stable\u2014but the get-the-p-value-unambiguously-low strategy seems reasonable.\n                \n                For other problems, such as in economics, political science, policy analysis, pharmacology, and other areas I\u2019ve worked with\u2014not to mention a lot of psychology!\u2014data are sparse, effects are context-dependent, and you\u2019re just not gonna get that near-certainty. For those problems I think a Bayesian approach is helpful. There are also decision problems such as A/B tests in industry where, for reasons discussed in my post above, a p-value or hypothesis-testing approach doesn\u2019t get at the costs and benefits of decision making.\n                \n                The other issue is the attitude that Bayesian inference is fundamentally unscientific because it uses the prior distribution, and Lakens (as you describe him) would like to just use data-based inference. I sympathize with that view! If people do an experiment, I want them to report their data; I\u2019m not so interested in their priors. When the message sent by the data is ambiguous, or when we need to make some decisions now before waiting for definitive data to arise, then Bayesian methods can help.\n                \n                In addition, applied statistics almost always involves generalizing from data to population, and it\u2019s usually impossible to do that without some modeling of the population\u2014call it Bayesian or call it whatever, in any case this generalization requires external information outside of the data.\n                \n            *   \\> applied statistics almost always involves generalizing from data to population\n                \n                It does if we imagine the \u201cpopulations\u201d required to make that true or reserve the \u201capplied statistics\u201d label for some inference problems only.\n                \n                \u201cJeffreys studied problems of geophysics, where one had a great deal of cogent prior information and a highly developed guiding theory (all of Newtonian mechanics giving the theory of elasticity and seismic wave propagation, plus the principles of physical chemistry and thermodynamics), and the data taking procedure had no resemblance to drawing from an urn. Fisher, in his cookbook (1925, Sect. 1) defines statistics as the study of populations; Jeffreys devotes virtually all of his analysis to problems of inference where there is no population.\u201d \\[E.

If I want to use data from past elections to generalize about the elections, or if I want to use data from several countries to generalize to another, I\u2019m not saying that elections or countries are being drawn from an urn, or anything like that. I\u2019m just defining the task.\n                \n            *   Andrew, right, but this idea that \u201cthe future is an urn we draw from\u201d is what I mean when I complain about Frequentist statistics making bad assumptions about random sequences. The passage of time does not leave very much \u201cstationary\u201d. Populations of animals, temperatures and rainfall in climate, the population of people who are prescribed a drug, the group of people who contract a disease, the land use patterns of north america, the income of factory workers, the voting patterns of blue collar workers in the south, suicide prevalence and geographic distribution\u2026 blablabla anything you could want to study is likely to change in time in mechanistic ways through a dynamical process\u2026 it\u2019s not like a fixed urn at all.\n                \n                At best, you might argue that the errors between your measured values and the predictions of the correct model might be urn-like, but even this may not be true when there are un-modeled effects whose magnitude changes, or when there are correlations between different errors, or when there are mode-switches between error causes (they may still remain mean zero but have different shapes)\n                \n                relying on samples from either measurements, or prediction errors to act like a stationary urn is just wrong in a deep way. It might seem more reasonable to some social science people because they\u2019ve never gotten to work with a model that is really actually good, like deflection of a beam as a function of load and cross section and stiffness, or orbital mechanics or even pharmacokinetics.\n                \n            *   Daniel:\n                \n                Agreed on [the importance of time](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/01/03/its-about-time-my-talk-for-the-upcoming-ny-r-conference/)\n                .\n                \n    *   Following up on Lakens, I read the section on Bayesian statistics in the online book that Daniel Lakeland pointed us to (thanks Daniel).

I will read the paper but I wanted to pre-register my intuition that this statement cannot be generally true, because the Bayes factor crucially depends on the prior specified.\n        \n        2\\. He also writes:\n        \n        \\> One should therefore not conclude that, for example, given a BF of 10, the alternative hypothesis is more likely to be true than the null hypothesis. The correct claim is that people should update their belief in the alternative hypothesis by a factor of 10.\n        \n        This is an interesting point; can we ever talk about what is true once we have done any statistical hypothesis test? Do Bayesians really claim that a BF of 10 means that the alternative is more likely to be true? If people do claim this, I would want to see some examples.\n        \n        3\\.

I haven\u2019t read the Raftery article it mentions, but I can see why psych type people (including people like Lakens) would ignore the point made in this 1995 paper, which is that one can decide which model is OK for one\u2019s current purposes by studying the posterior predictive distribution with reference to the observed data; one does not need to do formal model selection as such (I think this is one major point in the paper). I think that nobody will care about the posterior predictive distribution in the Lakens\u2019 type world, because there the usual question they are trying to answer is always of the type, is the difference between condition a and b different from zero or not? If one were to use posterior predictive distributions, one could basically choose either the null or alternative model (the models with the parameter of interest absent or present) and get basically the same posterior predictive distributions. The approach in the 1995 paper seems to be literally about model selection, whereas the way BIC as a proxy for Bayes factors, or p-values or AIC or whatever, is used is not just for model selection but for hypothesis testing. The people who care only about hypothesis testing won\u2019t really care much about trying to figure out which model makes more sense given the data (using posterior predictive distributions). So I think this paper would not attract any attention in the standard psych crowd, it seems orthogonal to their needs.\n                \n                I suspect that Lakens and his ilk are catering to the scientist spending their lives trying to figure out if condition a is different from condition b or not. That\u2019s not Andrew\u2019s main concern in life, as I understand it. So there is no common ground in this discussion.\n                \n            *   How often is \u2018is condition A different than condition B?\u2019 the most interesting or useful question in psychology though? I encounter this a lot too in agronomic research, and seem to spend a lot of time arguing instead that we already know that A and B are different \\*in some way or to some degree\\*, and the goal is to quantify that difference and its variability across contexts and conditions, and our corresponding uncertainty under different model assumptions. In some cases I can see it being useful to set up a null test like \u201cis well-characterized gene XY present in this sample or not?\u201d but that\u2019s where the underlying reality is plausibly discrete and dichotomous.\n                \n        *   Chris, you wrote:\n            \n            \\> the goal is to quantify that difference and its variability across contexts and conditions, and our corresponding uncertainty under different model assumptions.\n            \n            I think their response would be: \u201csays who? What I really want to know whether I can argue that the two conditions are different.\u201d For a psych type person (this includes my field of psycholinguistics), they start with a theory that says that condition a is harder to process than condition b or something. Telling them that we already know that there is already some difference or another does not address their research question. For example, in psycholinguistics a well-studied question is whether subject relatives are easier to process than object relatives in a particular region in the sentence. Some studies find a 50 ms difference in object minus subject relative reading time, some find 100 ms, some fine 200 or even 500 ms (IIRC), but for all these results, the one common thing people focus on is subject relatives are indeed easier to process than object relatives. Theory stands verified.\n            \n            I think that to even understand what you are saying, a 15 week course is needed to explain what uncertainty you are talking about; they will interpret uncertainty as the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the difference in means, whereas you mean the uncertainty of the actual effect of interest, which is an alien concept.\n            \n            Actually, I have experienced this feeling of not even understanding what the statistician is trying to tell me. I remember visiting Andrew in his office in Columbia sometime around 2006 or 2007 or so, and asking him some questions based on having read Gelman and Hill. I couldn\u2019t even understand his answer (I had a machine learning friend with me, and he then translated the answer later on by bringing it down to my level of understanding at the time).\n            \n            [Reply \u2193](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/07/10/three-cultures-bayes-subjective-objective-pragmatic/?replytocom=2375484#respond)\n            \n            *   Interesting take and I agree with your assessment there! In my area I think the dichotomania that feeds into this whole NHST business comes from two things primarily: 1. A desire to reduce complexity to tell a better cleaner story (so the fallacy of p > 0.05 = no effect or at least safely ignorable gets invoked), and 2. A desire to sift through real world decisions about eg whether to adopt various management practices which superficially ^seems^ like sometime that the condition a vs b p-value thresholding might tell you.  \n                Of course, both of these uses are totally fallacious, but you\u2019re right it requires a tremendous lift to disarm the intuitions that have been ingrained.  \n                It took me some time as well!\n                \n5.

Nowadays I\u2019m more inclined to give rationales for my methods (as you can see in my more recent books, or you can see in a book such as Richard McElreath\u2019s Statistical Rethinking book). The trouble was that, back in the early 1990s, Bayesian writing was often so full of philosophy; you\u2019d get chapters and chapters arguing about subjectivity or whatever, and then just the simplest models and applications. In writing our book, we made a conscious choice to get to the methods without getting into big Bayesian vs. non-Bayesian debates. There\u2019s some philosophy in the form of foundations of probability in chapter 1 of BDA, and there\u2019s some comparison with other methods in chapter 4 of BDA, but even there we tried to keep things focused on the models and methods and not yammer on about philosophical differences.

He was pretty much 100% committed to the idea that Bayesian statistics was a bad idea. It\u2019s possible that 8 more years of evidence might have changed his mind, but given his dismissal of the evidence already available to him in 2001, I doubt it.\n        \n        [Reply \u2193](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/07/10/three-cultures-bayes-subjective-objective-pragmatic/?replytocom=2375391#respond)\n        \n    *   Thanks\u2014fixed the typos.\n        \n        I took Breiman to be reacting to the bespoke by-hand construction of models in statistics vs. his learn-the-structure approach.

Also, he was involved in CART, which was much more of a fit-the-data approach than a learn-the-structure approach. I think he had a strong opposition to Bayesian models. Actually he said he didn\u2019t like models at all; on the other hand, his statistics textbook is full of the usual Poisson etc. models that you\u2019d see anywhere else. Like some of his colleagues, he seemed to be ok with models if he could just assume they were exactly correct (as in a textbook), but if any doubt came up, he wanted to abandon them entirely.\n            \n            Regarding Gaussian processes, I think his impression of them would depend on how they were presented. If you or I were to fit a Gaussian process model using Stan, I\u2019m almost certain he would\u2019ve hated it because he would\u2019ve said we\u2019re doing modeling, which he hated. But if someone with an anti-Bayesian affiliation were to fit a Gaussian process and give it some name like \u201cminimax L2 adaptive mesh,\u201d I guess he\u2019d be cool with it.\n            \n            [Reply \u2193](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/07/10/three-cultures-bayes-subjective-objective-pragmatic/?replytocom=2375437#respond)\n            \n8.

Bob  \n    Thank you for clarifying pragmatic Bayesianism. Is it hypothetical-deductive testing (as opposed to Bayesian updating)?

The goal of pragmatic Bayes isn\u2019t hypothesis testing, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about\u2014making a hard 0/1 decision about significance about some threshold. It can be about decisions, typically through a loss/utiliy function and posterior predictive event probabilities.\n        \n        As to beliefs about frequencies, I\u2019d say yes and no. I take frequencies to be theoretical abstractions\u2014events like coin flips aren\u2019t technically repeatable. We can use empirical frequency to measure how well calibrated a sequence of predictions is. I pretty much follow Laplace and take Bayesian stats to be epistemological.\n        \n        When I say a coin has a 50% chance of landing heads, I don\u2019t take that to be about long-term frequencies of an infinitely repeatable experiment, I take it to be about my knowledge of that particular coin flip. Same thing when a meteorologist says there\u2019s an 80% chance of rain (above some predefined threshold over some predefined area\u2014\u201crain today\u201d is pretty tricky to precisely define). It means given all they know (from current and historical measurements and science), 80% is their best estimate of how probable the event is. If it were Laplace\u2019s demon, who knows everything about the world and science, the demon would say 100% or 0%, because it\u2019d be able to work out exactly what was going to happen today. In other words, using probabilities for reasoning is consistent with a deterministic world that doesn\u2019t have probability built in. I know basically nothing about quantum physics beyond pop cartoons, so I\u2019m not saying the world isn\u2019t based on probabilities in some fundamental way. I\u2019m just saying that whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails may be predictable when the coin\u2019s in the air with better measurement and prediction.\n        \n        The concept of knowledge is tricky in that it doesn\u2019t have to be about me personally. A scientific field can make predictions based on its collective knowledge. But it\u2019s hard to characterize where knowledge lies in a community. Do I know that smoking causes cancer? Isn\u2019t it just that I\u2019m trusting medical science? Do I know that China lies on the other side of the world? I\u2019ve never been there, so I\u2019m just taking a lot of people\u2019s words for it! Similarly, the notions of intelligence, understanding, and even observation are very tricky to define, as the analytic philosophers discovered.\n        \n        If you want to talk about whether a squence of predictions is calibrated, we have to choose some chain of events to define that relative to, such as having me predict 100 coin flips or having a the National Weather Service predict rain on 100 consecutive days. In that sense, we can use something like frequencies to measure our models. I want to stress, though, that the events don\u2019t have to be literally repeatable\u2014the weather on each day is different, and each coin can be from a different country and era and tossed by a different person.\n        \n        [Reply \u2193](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/07/10/three-cultures-bayes-subjective-objective-pragmatic/?replytocom=2375435#respond)\n        \n        *   Regarding Bob\u2019s comment above: I\u2019d recommend chapter 1 of BDA to anyone with further interest in this topic, as we talk about the foundations of probability and give several examples.  \n            Also this post: [What is probability?](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/07/10/three-cultures-bayes-subjective-objective-pragmatic/#comment-2375437)\n              \n            And this: [Epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty: The role of context](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2022/02/03/epistemic-and-aleatoric-uncertainty/)\n            .\n            \n            [Reply \u2193](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/07/10/three-cultures-bayes-subjective-objective-pragmatic/?replytocom=2375439#respond)\n            \n10.

I\u2019m late to the party so not sure whether anybody will see this\u2026 anyway, here\u2019s a remark on informative priors. I think if we are honest we can\u2019t deny the importance of non-objective decisions here in the sense that there may indeed be useful knowledge that deserves to be incorporated in the modelling, however knowledge is typically at least to some extent non-quantitative and will not translate directly into a prior. The subjectivists of course would also want to use and incorporate all available information into the prior design, however they have a point arguing that there is no objective way doing it.\n    \n    I\u2019d agree with saying that information encoded should if possible be based on \u201cknowledge\u201d rather than \u201cbelief\u201d, but I think we need to accept that knowledge doesn\u2019t normally determine the prior, and \u201cbelief about how things will play out\u201d is at least a guideline for translating knowledge into a prior. Just talking about knowledge and not about belief doesn\u2019t mean that we get out of making certain subjective assessments and decisions there, and checking against the data cannot remove all this for reasons of identifiability.\n    \n    Another issue is that important knowledge is often not so much about the scientific question or the data collection, but rather about properties of Bayesian inference when using certain types of priors (like modelling variance independent of means and the like), and prior choices are made to avoid certain issues and artifacts with little reference to scientific question and data collection. This often requires informative priors, but the \u201cinformation\u201d is of a different kind of what it is often portrayed to be in the Bayesian framework.\n    \n    Regarding the \u201cphilosophy\u201d, I do find important that whether the pragmatic framework we\u2019d be interested in modelling the data generating process (which is a frequentist concept of probability without using what is known as frequentist inference), or the researcher\u2019s belief (which would be the traditional subjectivist stance), aleatory vs. epistemic probability. I\u2019d think it\u2019s the former, and Andrew has confirmed this in some instances, however this may be a hard sell to some Bayesians who think that all that\u2019s called \u201cfrequentist\u201d is evil.\n    \n    [Reply \u2193](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/07/10/three-cultures-bayes-subjective-objective-pragmatic/?replytocom=2375966#respond)\n    \n    *   Next to last sentence was meant to be:\n        \n        Regarding the \u201cphilosophy\u201d, I do find important whether in the pragmatic framework we\u2019d be interested in models of the data generating process (which is a frequentist concept of probability without using what is known as frequentist inference), or of the researcher\u2019s belief (which would be the traditional subjectivist stance), aleatory vs. epistemic probability.\n        \n        [Reply \u2193](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/07/10/three-cultures-bayes-subjective-objective-pragmatic/?replytocom=2375967#respond)\n        \n        *   There\u2019s nothing frequentist about data generating processes.\n            \n            Suppose I have a formula for how long it takes for a ball to fall to the earth from a certain height.

My point is not the you \\*should\\* do that; as I said I\u2019m fine with what you wrote. However I think it is important to nunderstand what you model, and whether it actually is the DGP or your information/epistemic state about it. Whether data have the authority to refute the model is what makes the difference (maybe not necessarily the only difference but probably the key one,)\n                \n                Also note that I\u2019m not talking about whether the DGP is \u201creally\u201d frequentist or not, rather about whether we attempt to model it as such, which I believe can make sense even if it in fact isn\u2019t (as I generally think that models are essentially different from reality and demanding that models are \u201ctrue\u201d is a category error).\n                \n            *   Sure I think we are mostly in agreement there. However It\u2019s not that Data can\u2019t refute the epistemic model, it\u2019s that it can\u2019t refute by failing to have a certain frequency in long run (failing to have a certain histogram day)\n                \n                You can refute a Bayesian model by collecting data which, no matter what the parameters values, sits in a low probability section of the data space.\n                \n                If my model says data x\\_i should be a sequence where every value is \u201cnear 0\u201d on the scale of single digit numbers and I collect data like 100,-90,73,51,-338\n                \n                The model is refuted, because the data is very low probability given the model. p(data|model) is very small.\n                \n            *   The model can still be a correct model of you epistemic state before seeing the data, and in this sense is not refuted (and as long as the data don\u2019t have likelihood zero, you could still update the model using the data in the standard way). Only if you say that it\u2019s a model of the data generating process, it is refuted.\n                \n                I have used bad wording when I wrote that \u201cthis is a frequentist concept\u201d. In fact I should have written (according to the wording I\u2019d normally use) that this is an aleatory concept of probability, as opposed to epistemic, and frequentism is the most prominent but not the only aleatory concept. Insofar you are right. (I have a bad habit of using the term \u201cfrequentism\u201d occasionally for something more general than it actually is. just because most readers here and elsewhere seem to be familiar with the term frequentism but not with aleatory probability.)\n                \n            *   I generally think of two layers in Bayesian models. At the first layer is the description of some mechanism. Like, \u201cbecause of the physics of electrons in bimetallic junctions, the voltage across these terminals will be close to some function of temperature: v ~ f(T)\u201d\n                \n                This is \u201caleatoric\u201d (or maybe I prefer \u201cmechanistic\u201d)\n                \n                The next statement \u201cI will model my knowledge of the voltage as v ~ Normal(f(T),s)\u201d can be thought of as pure epistemic knowledge about the difference between my idealized aleatoric model and the reality of all the things that could \u201cgo wrong\u201d to make the error different from 0.\n                \n                If you don\u2019t separate into these layers, then you can incorrectly imagine v ~ Normal(f(T),s) as a frequentist probability model. In your case, you\u2019ve clarified that you agree v ~ Normal(f(T),s) need not be frequentist (that is, in the long run it\u2019s not a refutation of the model if the histogram of errors deviates potentially quite a bit from IID Normal, like perhaps it might turn out to be a triangle with finite tails or a t type distribution with fat tails or be slightly skewed or have two minor lobes in the tails or have serial correlations.\n                \n                I guess it\u2019s just a matter of the meaning of words if you take an aleatory model (ie. a model of a functional form between temperature and voltage based on physical principles) and you add epistemic uncertainty to the error, whether you\u2019ve got an \u201caleatory\u201d or \u201cepistemic\u201d model.\n                \n                In my view, it\u2019s important that Bayes offers us a way to take our mechanistic models and add epistemic uncertainty about them on top in a generic way that doesn\u2019t depend on \\*changing the mechanism\\*\u2026 Frequentist models implicitly assume a mechanism involving \\*strong randomness\\* (ie. high kolmogorov complexity sequences, things that are in principle unpredictable). Frequentist tests rely on that strong randomness to be correct. If you include serial correlations with a particular functional form, or make the errors fall on some manifold in high dimensions\u2026 the tests fail to do what they are supposed it.\n                \n                So, I don\u2019t reject the idea that yes, probability models are about the way the world works, I just reject that the world corresponds to maximal kolmogorov complexity sequences.\n                \n            *   Ok, rethinking this and looking up the definition of \u201caleatoric\u201d to remind myself, no, I think the proper term for my view is \u201cmechanistic\u201d. The v ~ Normal(f(T),s) type model is not (usually) modeling \u201crandomness\u201d it\u2019s modeling \u201cknowledge of discrepancy\u201d.\n                \n                there may well and truly be high kolmogorov complexity type randomness of iid type and stable distribution in the discrepancy, but there need not be. For example there might be serial correlations we simply aren\u2019t aware of.\n                \n                Also typically if you want to model a frequency type randomness in Bayesian models you\u2019d use\n                \n                v ~ HighParameterDistribution(f(T),param\\_vector)\n                \n                with uncertainty on the param\\_vector and the HighParameterDistribution is of flexible shape. If you want to learn the shape of a stable frequency distribution you need to do that directly. There might sometimes be physical/mechanistic reasons, or just historical data, to believe in a certain parametric shape of the distribution, but that\u2019s often not the case (for example, the error in predicting the number of grams of alcohol consumed on average weekly by a given survey participant).\n                \n                In \\*most\\* cases I don\u2019t see what the point is of Frequentist models with assumed forms and tests based on them which we reject or accept. When we reject a frequentist model it tells us that the world didn\u2019t work like that random number generator. But this is a fact we usually knew or should have known ahead of time. And when we don\u2019t reject, it\u2019s usually just that we don\u2019t have enough data. The only exception in my mind is where we have a large historical dataset and can see that the frequency behavior was a stable property of the system, and we\u2019re trying to detect a change from that stability.\n                \n            *   I don\u2019t mind the use of the word \u201cmechanistic\u201d for what I call \u201caleatory\u201d. I however don\u2019t agree with your demand that the world has to be truly frequentist for a frequentist interpretation of probability to make sense. My general view is that reality is essentially different from the models we use, and demanding models to be \u201ctrue\u201d is pointless and a category error. My view on this (and uses and issues with both aleatory/frequentist and epistemic probability) is given here in much detail: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05748](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05748)\n                \n            *   Christian:\n                \n                Of course models differ from reality. The problem with doing frequentist tests is that you intend to do something like:\n                \n                \u201cdoes the world work like random number generator with parameters a,b,c?\u201d\n                \n                and when you reject it, it could be because\n                \n                1) The world isn\u2019t like that class of random number generator at all (serial correlations, different distributional shape, mixture models, non-stationary through time, blablabla.)  \n                2) The world is like a random number generator except with parameter values q,r,s.\n                \n                In most cases people want to find out something closer to (2) but it\u2019s usually the case that (1) fails.\n                \n                When you\u2019re rejecting a null hypothesis and deciding to \u201caccept an alternative hypothesis that the parameters are maybe more like q,r,s\u201d you almost always need to consider \u201cwhat if it\u2019s just not a random number generator at all, and the frequency properties of the test are just detecting that this thing doesn\u2019t behave randomly?\u201d\n                \n                Most people don\u2019t consider that issue, and yet, almost everything they do would fail a battery of tests used for PRNG testing (even a lot of PRNGs that people use in practice fail good PRNG testing).\n                \n            *   Daniel: Well, the original posting wasn\u2019t about frequentist inference, so probably this is not the right place to have this discussion (other than the fact that this isn\u2019t the first time we have it).\n                \n                Just this: You don\u2019t need to convince me regarding widespread misuse and misinterpretation of hypothesis tests.

But the author, who knows far more academic statisticians than I do, explicitly says that he had the same belief and &quot;was shocked to learn that statisticians didn\u2019t think this way.&quot;\n  - **klysm** (): The no iteration thing is very real and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s even for particularly bad reasons. We iterate on models to make them better, by some definition of better. It\u2019s no secret that scientific work is subject to rather perverse incentives around thresholds of significance and positive results. Publish or perish. Perverse incentives lead to perverse statistics.<p>The iteration itself is sometimes viewed directly as a problem. The \u201cgarden of forking paths\u201d, where the analysis depends on the data, is viewed as a direct cause for some of the statistical and epistemological crises in science today.<p>Iteration itself isn\u2019t inherently bad. It\u2019s just that the objective function usually isn\u2019t what we want from a scientific perspective.<p>To those actually doing scientific work, I suspect iterating on their models feels like they\u2019re doing something unfaithful.<p>Furthermore, I believe a lot of these issues are strongly related to the flawed epistemological framework which many scientific fields seem to have converged: p&lt;0.05 means it\u2019s true, otherwise it\u2019s false.<p>edit:<p>Perhaps another way to characterize this discomfort is by the number of degrees of freedom that the analyst controls. In a Bayesian context where we are picking priors either by belief or previous data, the analyst has a _lot_ of control over how the results come out the other end.<p>I think this is why fields have trended towards a set of \u2018standard\u2019 tests instead of building good statistical models. These take most of the knobs out of the hands of the analyst, and generally are more conservative.\n    - **joeyo** (): <p><pre><code>  &gt; Iteration itself isn\u2019t inherently bad.

In particular, the article&#x27;s definition of pragmatic Bayes says that &quot;the model should be consistent with knowledge about the underlying scientific problem and the data collection process,&quot; which I don&#x27;t consider the norm in ML at all.<p>I do think ML practitioners in general align with the &quot;iteration&quot; category in my characterization, though you could joke that that miscategorizes people who just use (boosted trees|transformers) for everything.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projecteuclid.org&#x2F;journals&#x2F;statistical-science&#x2F;volume-16&#x2F;issue-3&#x2F;Statistical-Modeling--The-Two-Cultures-with-comments-and-a&#x2F;10.1214&#x2F;ss&#x2F;1009213726.full\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projecteuclid.org&#x2F;journals&#x2F;statistical-science&#x2F;volum...</a>\n- **thegginthesky** (): I miss the college days where professors would argue endlessly on Bayesian vs Frequentist.<p>The article is very well succinct and even explains why even my Bayesian professors had different approaches to research and analysis.

That&#x27;s it.  An enormous mathematical apparatus was built around answering those two questions in the context of the limitations in point #2.\n    - **refulgentis** (): I see, so academics are frequentists (attackers) or objective Bayes (naive), and the people Doing Science are pragmatic (correct).<p>The article gave me the same vibe, nice, short set of labels for me to apply as a heuristic.<p>I never really understood this particular war, I&#x27;m a simpleton, A in Stats 101, that&#x27;s it. I guess I need to bone up on Wikipedia to understand what&#x27;s going on here more.\n    - **skissane** (): &gt; - subjective Bayes is the strawman that frequentist academics like to attack<p>I don\u2019t get what all the hate for subjective Bayesianism is. It seems the most philosophically defensible approach, in that all it assumes is our own subjective judgements of likelihood, the idea that we can quantify them (however in exactly), and the idea (avoid Dutch books) that we want to be consistent (most people do).<p>Whereas, objective Bayes is basically subjective Bayes from the viewpoint of an idealised perfectly rational agent - and \u201cperfectly rational\u201d seems philosophically a lot more expensive than anything subjective Bayes relies on.\n- **derbOac** (): I never liked the clubs you were expected to put yourself in, what &quot;side&quot; you were on, or the idea that problems in science that we see today could somehow be reduced to the inferential philosophy you adopt. In a lot of ways I see myself as information-theoretic in orientation, so maybe objective Bayesian, although it&#x27;s really neither frequentist nor Bayesian.<p>This three cultures idea is a bit of slight of hand in my opinion, as the &quot;pragmatic&quot; culture isn&#x27;t really exclusive of subjective or objective Bayesianism and in that sense says nothing about how you should approach prior specification or interpretation or anything. Maybe Gelman would say a better term is &quot;flexibility&quot; or something but then that leaves the question of when you go objective and when you go subjective and why. Seems better to formalize that than leave it as a bit of smoke and mirrors. I&#x27;m not saying some flexibility about prior interpretation and specification isn&#x27;t a good idea, just that I&#x27;m not sure that approaching theoretical basics with the answer &quot;we&#x27;ll just ignore the issues and pretend we&#x27;re doing something different&quot; is quite the right answer.<p>Playing a bit of devil&#x27;s advocate too, the &quot;pragmatic&quot; culture reveals a bit about <i>why</i> Bayesianism is looked at with a bit of skepticism and doubt. &quot;Choosing a prior&quot; followed by &quot;seeing how well everything fits&quot; and then &quot;repeating&quot; looks a lot like model tweaking or p-hacking. I know that&#x27;s not the intent, and it&#x27;s impossible to do modeling without tweaking, but if you approach things that way, the prior just looks like one more degree of freedom to nudge things around and fish with.<p>I&#x27;ve published and edited papers on Bayesian inference, and my feeling is that the problems with it have never been in the theory, which is solid. It&#x27;s in how people use and abuse it in practice.\n"}]}

One major unsexy architectural choice has proved itself: complete customer isolation.\n\n* * *\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nFundamentally, Canary relies on two components: the Canary devices (hardware or virtual) that are deployed in customer infrastructure, and the Console (which we run) that these Canaries report into. Very broadly this is identical to most cloud-managed device or appliance products: appliances send telemetry to the cloud. It\u2019s typical for cloud-managed devices to report to a _single_ endpoint (e.g. one HTTPS service), or perhaps a region-specific endpoint.[1](#925d468e-bde0-4cd8-a7d0-966e252f595e)\n In those products, devices are managed via a website that is multi-tenanted (i.e. the same management site is shared by multiple customers). This comes with multiple operational and cost benefits, and is a natural choice.\n\nExcept, we don\u2019t make that choice. Every Canary customer has their own tenant, the Console.\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.thinkst.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-4.png?resize=960%2C436&ssl=1)\n\nEach customer gets their own Console\n\nWhy? Well, that\u2019s the point of this post.\u00a0[Canary](https://canary.tools/)\n\u00a0is assessed by external security testers on a regular basis. It\u2019s always fun watching security testers\u2019 reactions when they\u2019re told that Canary customers aren\u2019t colocated. Faces fall, furious notes are taken, and followup questions come thick and fast to try to figure out new (meaningful) angles of attack.\n\nI used to do the same kind of security consulting, and unauthorized access to other users\u2019 data was an issue we reliably found when testing multi-tenant applications (especially web applications). There are so many avenues to explore. Insecure direct object references (e.g. you can access anyone\u2019s bank statement by iterating through the numeric statement ID parameter in the URL [https://vulnerablebank.com/account/statment?id=4728309](https://vulnerablebank.com/account/statment?id=4728309)\n), Cross-site scripting bugs using in-app messaging between users, server-side bugs which let the attacker gain local access to the server and thereby view all data, query injection bugs (such as SQLi) which let the attacker extract data directly out the DB without further checks, and many more. A root cause for those attacks we found was that unrelated organisations\u2019 data was colocated.\n\nWhen we designed Canary\u2019s architecture, we explicitly wanted to keep customer data separated by a strong boundary, not just application-level permissions checks. We picked a model that gave us complete isolation between customers: they wouldn\u2019t share services, datastores, and resources like IP addresses.\u00a0\n\nThis came with drawbacks on the operational side (and influenced the product design), but we\u2019ve been extremely happy with the trade. In this post, we\u2019ll explore the model more, and point to clear examples of where it worked for us. Let\u2019s start with a short explanation of what services we actually run.\n\nService Requirements\n--------------------\n\nIn delivering Thinkst Canary to our customers, we have several services that must be run. The Console is a website run on a uWSGI and Nginx; there\u2019s honeypot configuration and alert data that must be persistently stored and retrieved quickly; there\u2019s services to communicate with the deployed devices; there are Canarytoken services which serve HTTP and DNS traffic on a separate IP from the management interface; and there\u2019s a separate service to ship alerts via Syslog for customers who opt for it.\n\nAll combined, these make up the Thinkst Canary product.\n\nOur architecture: VM isolation\n------------------------------\n\nAll the aforementioned Canary Console services for a single customer are contained within their own AWS EC2 instance. In other words, we run a VM per customer.\n\nIn some circles, this approach isn\u2019t considered sexy. There are no containers, no serverless functions, no cloud databases, no hyperscale support, no message buses (well\u2026 there are but they exist on the instance only), no load balancers, no k8s clusters. Nothing here will earn us a speaking invite to CNCF events, or an architecture diagram full of AWS service icons, and we happily accept this trade off.\n\nThe thing is, cloud architectures can become caricatures of themselves. AWS\u2019 reference design to host WordPress inside AWS looks like this:\n\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcPX6K-s_mJ7NbCDInyHF4noJsl8YpxQnKo4TIB3korXNQVzcfObKqbAOElmifvMm7xLPQTMNZ1Xv99Rk137hoQvT26yYPIGbvH06O_PCyLwQT4bBI8KtFufxbIEdwfsqRt-9hnVuFpV7phqGl7J2ImyJPZ?key=P9OtcW-1UE1as9LeMAioIw)\n\nAll this, and still no one reads my blog\n\nBroadly speaking, the main beneficiaries of Cloud-native architectures are the developers and operators of a service, not their customers. Your customers don\u2019t care whether your database is hosted at RDS, or Aurora, or if it\u2019s MySQL running on a 1U in a colocation data centre, so long as they can access the data reliably, safely, and quickly. Cloud-native tech makes it easier for _developers and operators_ to build such systems, but customers (on average) don\u2019t have requirements for whether Cloud tech is used (or not).\n\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd9cFq9TBaLX6p27RTSN7JLXFC6TUeUdk8aLLobLlbs3JEhBv6q-wf3UXhslFIbK_2-gmsQvbfA4xHjt5J1VofPVAWFqxOc59AnXrk_QsKhN877pQT63WOM7e-10XbR0epgsOP0WJgQy0mdrNWI1jjgdzrb?key=P9OtcW-1UE1as9LeMAioIw)\n\nThis is what Customers care about: can I login and see my data?\n\nChoosing Cloud-native technologies and approaches comes with its own baggage. For us, the primary issue is that the security boundary that separates customers from each other becomes an application issue, and that is too risky. As a security vendor, a breach of customer data is a nightmare scenario for us.\n\nConsider, for example, a standard deployment model where customer data all resides in a single database or small number of databases (could be relational DB, or a document database, or similar). The boundaries between that data would either be enforced by the database through different users and roles, or (more typically) through the querying application applying authorisation checks after data has been retrieved from the database or as part of the query supplied by the application to the database. If the application is responsible for maintaining the boundary, then any vulnerability which allows an attacker to bypass the authorisation check would violate the boundary. Every query, every data retrieval is a potential source of vulnerabilities, and must be carefully guarded. No mistakes. This is true whenever either the data is colocated, or users rely on the same endpoints and web addresses to access data. It\u2019s frighteningly common for these issues to occur.\n\nReworking our web backend to rely on Lambdas would be a terrible approach for several reasons, and also ignores the interrelationship between the other services (such as device communications). Likewise, AWS IoT is a non-starter for managing our devices; we operate in networks where outbound MQTT and HTTPS is simply not allowed (which is why we rely on encrypted DNS traffic for device-to-Console communication). In other words, piecing together the same service from the Lego blocks of AWS services would result in a more cumbersome and less Customer-focused product. Instead, if we take on the responsibility of building those blocks ourselves, we can run a service that fits together beautifully, like an intricate custom puzzle.\n\nThe isolated VM approach has drawbacks, which we\u2019ll touch on shortly, but it has more benefits.\n\n* * *\n\nBenefits\n--------\n\n### Outsourcing the hardest problem\n\nIn going with this battle-tested approach, we\u2019re cleanly relying on the AWS hypervisor to maintain a silicone-assisted security boundary. Arguably entire AWS\u2019 computing business rests on the strength of their hypervisor.[2](#09dbe066-795f-4fb4-a3f2-ccd1ed46d6a7)\n Bugs in their hypervisor that yield cross-customer access are an existential threat to AWS, and they have a deeply vested interest in maintaining that boundary. They have proved themselves to be excellent in running and maintaining this hypervisor over a long period of time.[3](#b897f452-af23-49f8-b39d-ec385abe571c)\n And, in the extreme event that a 0day hypervisor bug is used to attack a Canary customer, even then a) an attacker would need to first need to colocate their attack VM on the same physical host as our customer\u2019s VM, and b) only one customer would be affected; the splash zone is naturally limited.\n\n### Performance and monitoring\n\nRunning all services related to a single customer on the same instance makes certain kinds of monitoring and investigating much simpler. We don\u2019t need to collect performance data from multiple systems to understand what one customer is experiencing; it\u2019s already all in the one place. We run a custom DNS server, and at times debugging involves packet captures to understand issues; it\u2019s extremely helpful knowing that traffic at the Console is related to the customer issue being investigated.\n\nThe inverse is also true. Isolating a customer\u2019s services to a VM means any spike in usage or service degradation is constrained to just that Console. Faults occur; we see EC2 hardware issues on a regular basis and when those occur it\u2019s a single Console affected (and automatically restored), not an entire service for all customers. In a hypothetical scenario where all our services run in, say, a Kubernetes cluster, all our eggs are in the k8s basket. A k8s failure takes out all customers[4](#ae9da95a-5552-4545-af01-59f9bf948b5c)\n; in the VM model, you have to reach \u201cAWS in several regions fails simultaneously\u201d to find the single-point of failure.\n\nIsolated VMs are just a step away from the original horizontal scaling (i.e. more physical servers). Our scaling model when adding more customers is to duplicate the infrastructure for them, not to squeeze them in alongside everyone else. That means we don\u2019t focus on hyper optimising a handful of services that all customers wind up using. Our Consoles have small compute needs and in most cases run \u201csmall\u201d EC2 instances. Mean load is usually something like 0.04, and the 99th percentile load is 0.5.\u00a0\n\n### Regulatory compliance\n\nPer-customer VMs means we can easily meet regulatory burdens; some customers need to keep their data in one geographic region for compliance reasons. It\u2019s trivial for us to handle these requests and currently can add entire new regions in the space of hours to our supported list. If, instead, we relied on shared infrastructure, then new regions would be big and expensive additions.\n\n### Staged rollouts\n\nThis approach also means we can rollout code and features to subsets of customers trivially before making them generally available. New code is deployed in a staggered manner across the fleet and, as a side-effect, rollouts will be paused if we see errors before code makes it to all customers.\n\n### Operational security\n\nWe can also implement IP-filtering at the security group level for customers, should they require it. This level of isolation is simply not possible on shared infrastructure.\n\nIn building the application our user model is simplified because we don\u2019t need to take into account an organisation boundary between data sets. We have users of different permission levels, but they all belong to the same organisation. This makes authorisation code easier to reason about, and helps speed up development.\u00a0\n\n* * *\n\nFalse Benefits\n--------------\n\nOne supposed argument in favour of the VM model is that it decreases your dependency on any single cloud provider, and makes it easier to switch because theoretically you can simply run your VM elsewhere. While it\u2019s true that we\u2019re not fully dependent on AWS for the compute environment (because we supply our own VM), we\u2019re still reliant on other AWS services, especially around monitoring, orchestration, and network services. Switching to another provider would be non-trivial, and I don\u2019t see the VM as a real benefit in this regard. The barrier to switching is still incredibly high.\n\n* * *\n\nDrawbacks\n---------\n\nThe flipside of the coin is that we incur a greater operational cost in terms of both effort and spend. Maintaining thousands of instances requires us to be proficient in configuration management. We need to think both in terms of configuration at scale (managing thousands of instances), and very local issues (a recent example is Ubuntu changing the behaviour of /tmp permissions, necessitating customisations to /etc/sysctl.conf. In a container world, someone else would have likely handled that.) Our Linux sysadmin skills have stood us in good stead; without decent sysadmin skills this path would have been a tricky one to pursue.\n\nI\u2019ve not even touched on the impact on _product design_ that isolated VMs brings, but suffice it to say it\u2019s deeply built into Canary; when we ship devices (hardware or otherwise), they need a path to discover their Console, which is a whole separate topic.\n\n### Custom monitoring\n\nWhile AWS provides instance checks to track instance health, we\u2019ve had to build all sorts of monitoring, because the built-in AWS monitoring tools weren\u2019t sufficient for what we needed. Consider that we have thousands of instances (and IPs), with corresponding DNS entries and multiple services (speaking both DNS and HTTP). We want to know within minutes if any of them become unresponsive, and we had to build that tooling ourselves. In addition, on-instance monitoring is also performed to understand whether we\u2019re approaching a failure mode on a Console.\n\n### Hardware reliance and limitations\n\nI mentioned above that hardware fault isolation is a benefit, since it only affects that one Console on the broken hardware. The consequence of this is that one customer is offline until our tooling automatically restarts the VM. This typically happens within minutes of the failure.\n\nWhile we\u2019ve not come close to approaching any real instance size limit, there\u2019s a theoretical limit in having a single instance per customer: it\u2019s the largest available EC2 instance. But it\u2019s not a concern for us; we\u2019re not yet at the halfway point in the EC2 instance size progression even for our most demanding customers (and instance sizes double on each step).\n\n### Slower rollouts\n\nRolling out code across thousands of instances usually takes a couple of hours because we perform the rollout in increasingly larger sets. If we simply ran a handful of massive servers or clusters, code rollout would likely be faster.\n\n### Cost\n\nLastly, this approach is almost certainly more expensive. Our instances sit idle for the most part and we pay EC2 a pretty penny for the privilege. This is likely the biggest drawback for most organisations considering this approach. (It\u2019s worth noting that we bootstrapped Thinkst and never took external funding. While this approach _is_ more costly than the traditional model, it\u2019s certainly not prohibitive because the cost scales linearly as you gain customers. If you\u2019re in the red and are hoping to improve operating margins by cramming more customers onto the same compute, this approach isn\u2019t for you. It won\u2019t work with negative profit margins, as every new customer scales the cost linearly.)\n\nWith all these drawbacks, the benefits still far outweigh them in our view. We can point to concrete moments when the isolated VM model has proved its mettle.\n\n* * *\n\nCase Studies\n------------\n\n### Case Study 1: Debug console\n\nIn [our early days](https://blog.thinkst.com/2018/12/making-nginx-slightly-less-surprising.html)\n we had an incident on a Console, in which a developer left a debugger exposed to the Web. If customer data had been present on that Console, then we\u2019d have had to roll external incident response along with publishing breach announcements. Instead, the isolated VM (which was the developer\u2019s VM) meant there was no customer data on that VM at all. After detecting the incident we simply burned that infrastructure to the ground, and built in controls to ensure the same bug could never leave us open again.\n\n### Case Study 2: Web application bugs\n\nThrough the years of security assessments we\u2019ve undergone, the assessors have found several common bug classes. But they\u2019ve never discovered access to another customer\u2019s data. We prefer crystal box testing and hand over source code during tests; even after extremely clever exploits with full source code access, it\u2019s impossible to read data that simply isn\u2019t there.\n\n### Case Study 3: osslsigncode\n\nEarlier this year [we found out](https://blog.thinkst.com/2024/07/unobtrusively-upgrading-ubuntu-underfoot.html)\n that, despite paying for security patches in Ubuntu, we still had a vulnerable version of a package called osslsigncode installed due to Canonical refusing to upgrade the package in contravention of their advertising copy. The situation is now resolved, but while this vulnerable version was present we had to conduct a risk assessment to determine whether we shipped our own version of the package or resolved the underlying issue by upgrading to an Ubuntu version where the fix was already provided.\n\nIf we relied on shared infrastructure, we\u2019d have to scramble to resolve the situation because of the risk that one customer exploits the vulnerability and gains access to the host that also handles another customer\u2019s data.\n\nHowever, because of the isolated VM model, the risk assessment had a different outcome. We reasoned that an attacker needed to be authenticated; that we don\u2019t have open registration; that the attacker would need to craft a custom exploit (no public exploit was or is available for this issue); and if exploited they\u2019d see only their own instance and their own data. The upside for the attacker would be: they can access their own data. This heavily discounts the value of the attack, and so the isolated VM gave us breathing room to resolve the issue in a deeper way.\n\n* * *\n\nShould you default to isolated VMs?\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe obvious answer is\u2026 there is no obvious answer. We\u2019ve thought about the tradeoffs, and for our risk profile the AWS hypervisor is the boundary we\u2019re most happy with. Our Customers are more interested in having their data remain their own, than whether we\u2019re running Canary with various pieces of Cloud tech. Returning to our opening question, we pick the unfashionable welding helmet over the Aviators for eclipse viewing, every time.\n\nWe know this introduces a cost, product-wise, operationally, and in terms of compute expense. We\u2019re happy to eat this because it lets us sleep better at night.\n\nThe tradeoff depends on whether you can afford the large slack in paying for mostly idle systems, have the sysadmin capacity to run thousands of instances, and are willing to reimplement tools specifically for your own infrastructure. The upside is a security boundary that is very, very hard. We\u2019re happy on this path.\n\n1.  A cluster might service the endpoints, but embedded in the appliance or device is a single or limited set or URLs. [\u21a9\ufe0e](#925d468e-bde0-4cd8-a7d0-966e252f595e-link)\n    \n2.  Even services which abstract away the idea of EC2 instances, like Lambdas, still run on VMs underneath and rely on the hypervisor. [\u21a9\ufe0e](#09dbe066-795f-4fb4-a3f2-ccd1ed46d6a7-link)\n    \n3.  When hypervisor bugs are published, AWS usually is given advanced notice in order to remediate the issue across all of AWS. [\u21a9\ufe0e](#b897f452-af23-49f8-b39d-ec385abe571c-link)\n    \n4.  Perhaps it\u2019s a mistyped administration command, or a configuration error, or an upgrade that didn\u2019t go according to plan. A Kubernetes failure would affect all Customers at once.

I, too, use VMs to isolate customers, and I use containers within those VMs, either with or without k8s.  These tools solve different problems.  Containers solve software management, whereas VMs provide a high degree of isolation.<p>Container orchestration is where I see the great mistake in all of this.  I consider everything running in a k8s cluster to be one &quot;blast domain.&quot;  Containers can be escaped.  Faulty containers impact everyone relying on a cluster.  Container orchestration is the thing I believe is &quot;overused.&quot;  It was designed to solve &quot;hyper&quot; scale problems, and it&#x27;s being misused in far more modest use cases where VMs should prevail.  I believe the existence of container orchestration and its misapplication has retarded the development of good VM tools: I dream of tools that create, deploy and manage entire VMs with the same ease as Docker, and that these tools have not matured and gained popularity because container orchestration is so easily misapplied.<p>Strongly disagree about containers and dev&#x2F;deployment (&quot;NOT check&quot;).  I can no longer imagine development without containers: it would be intolerable.  Container repos are a godsend for deployment.\n    - **rodgerd** (): &gt; Container orchestration is the thing I believe is &quot;overused.&quot; It was designed to solve &quot;hyper&quot; scale problems, and it&#x27;s being misused in far more modest use cases where VMs should prevail.<p>As a relatively early corporate adopter of k8s, this is absolutely correct. There are problems where k8s is actually easier than building the equivalent capability elsewhere, but a lot of uses it&#x27;s put to seem to be driven more by a desire to have kubernetes on one&#x27;s resume.\n    - **marcosdumay** (): &gt; It was designed to solve &quot;hyper&quot; scale problems<p>Even then, IMO, it makes too little sense. It would be a bit useful if non-used containers wasted a lot of resources, or if you could get an unlimited amount of them from somewhere.<p>But no, just creating all the containers you can and leaving them there wastes almost nothing, they are limited by the hardware you have or rent, and the thing clouds can rent are either full VMs or specialized single-application sandboxes.<p>AFAIK, containers solve the &quot;how do I run both this PHP7 and this PHP8 applications on my web server?&quot; problem, and not much more.\n    - **trueismywork** (): Which language do you develop in?\n  - **everforward** (): &gt; Modern &quot;containers&quot; were invented to make thinks more reproducible ( check ) and simplify dev and deployments ( NOT check ).<p>I do strongly believe deployments of containers are easier.  If you want something that parallels a raw VM, you can &quot;docker run&quot; the image.  Things like k8s can definitely be complicated, but the parallel there is more like running a whole ESXi cluster.  Having done both, there&#x27;s really only a marginal difference in complexity between k8s and an ESXi cluster supporting a similar feature set.<p>The dev simplification is supposed to be &quot;stop dealing with tickets from people with weird environments&quot;, though it admittedly often doesn&#x27;t apply to internal application where devs have some control over the environment.<p>&gt; Personally FreeBSD Jails &#x2F; Solaris Zones are the thing I like to dream are pretty much as secure as a VM and a perfect fit for a sane dev and ops workflow<p>I would be interested to hear how you use them.  From my perspective, raw jails&#x2F;zones are missing features and implementing those features on top of them ends up basically back at Docker (probably minus the virtual networking).  E.g. jails need some way to get new copies of the code that runs in them, so you can either use Docker or write some custom Ansible&#x2F;Chef&#x2F;etc that does basically the same thing.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m wrong, and there is some zen to be found in raw-er tools.\n- **ploxiln** (): &gt; we operate in networks where outbound MQTT and HTTPS is simply not allowed (which is why we rely on encrypted DNS traffic for device-to-Console communication)<p>HTTPS is not allowed (locked down for security!), so communication is smuggled over DNS? uhh ... I suspect that a lot of what the customer &quot;security&quot; departments do, doesn&#x27;t really make sense ...\n  - **jmprspret** (): DNS tunneling, or smuggling through DNS requests, is like a known malware C2 method. Seems really weird to (ab)use it for &quot;&quot;security&quot;&quot;\n    - **thinkst** (): Product builders can learn loads from malware in terms of deployment and operational ease. Malware needs to operate without any assistance in unknown environments. Nobody is allowing outbound comms deliberately for malware, so tunnel methods were developed.<p>Networks have these capabilities, inherently they&#x27;re part of the specs. But only malware seems to realise that and use it. We love reusing offensive techniques for defence (see our Canarytokens stuff), and DNS comms fits that perfectly. Our customers get an actual 2-minute install, not a 2-minute-and-then-wait-a-week-for-the-firewall-rules install.\n- **bobbob1921** (): My big struggle with docker&#x2F;containers vs VMs is the storage layer (on containers).\n  I\u2019m sure it\u2019s mostly lack of experience &#x2F; knowledge on my end, but I never have a doubt or concern that my storage is persistent and clearly defined when using a VM based workload.\nI cannot say the same for my docker&#x2F;container based workloads, I\u2019m always a tad concerned about the persistence of storage, (or the resource management in regards to storage).\nThis becomes even more true as you deal with networked storage on both platforms\n  - **amluto** (): It absolutely boggles my mind that read-only mode is not the default in Docker. By default, every container has an extra, unnamed, writable volume: its own root. Typo in your volume mount?  You\u2019re writing to root, and you <i>will</i> lose data.<p>Of course, once this is fixed and you start using read-only containers, one wonders why \u201ccontainer\u201d exists as a persistent, named concept.\n    - **danhor** (): Because unless you resort to stuff like in-ram overlayfs which will also result in data loss, a lot of system software assumes it can write anywhere and will bitterly complain if not, even if it&#x27;s not &quot;real&quot; data, and can be very annoying to fix. That&#x27;s fina for carefully engineered containers, but the usual thrown together stuff docker started with gets a lot more annoying.\n  - **imp0cat** (): Mount those paths that you care about to local filesystem. Otherwise, you&#x27;re always one `docker system prune -a -f --volumes` from a disaster.\n"}]}

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has taken advantage of that loophole in the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures to force travelers to hand over data from their phones and laptops.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Judge Nina Morrison in the Eastern District of New York [ruled](https://knightcolumbia.org/documents/ymerpfopdw)\n that cellphone searches are a \"nonroutine\" search, more akin to a strip search than scanning a suitcase or passing a traveler through a metal detector.\n\nAlthough the interests of stopping contraband are \"undoubtedly served when the government searches the luggage or pockets of a person crossing the border carrying objects that can only be introduced to this country by being physically moved across its borders, the extent to which those interests are served when the government searches data stored on a person's cell phone is far less clear,\" the judge declared.\n\nMorrison noted that \"reviewing the information in a person's cell phone is the best approximation government officials have for mindreading,\" so searching through cellphone data has an even heavier privacy impact than rummaging through physical possessions. Therefore, the court ruled, a cellphone search at the border requires both probable cause _and_ a warrant. Morrison did not distinguish between scanning a phone's contents with [special software](https://reason.com/2024/06/27/baltimore-brings-back-controversial-cellphone-hacking-system/)\n and manually flipping through it.\n\nAnd in a victory for journalists, the judge specifically acknowledged the First Amendment implications of cellphone searches too. She cited reporting by [_The Intercept_](https://theintercept.com/2019/02/08/us-mexico-border-journalists-harassment/)\n and _[VICE](https://www.vice.com/en/article/78ke9q/wsj-reporter-homeland-security-tried-to-take-my-phones-at-the-border)\n_ about CPB searching journalists' cellphones \"based on these journalists' ongoing coverage of politically sensitive issues\" and warned that those phone searches could put confidential sources at risk.\n\nWednesday's ruling adds to a stream of cases restricting the feds' ability to search travelers' electronics. The 4th and 9th Circuits, which cover the mid-Atlantic and Western states, have ruled that border police need at least \"[reasonable suspicion](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB10387#:~:text=Under%20the%20border%20search%20exception%2C%20the%20government%20may%20conduct%20routine,manual%20searches%20of%20electronic%20devices.)\n\" of a crime to search cellphones. Last year, a judge in the Southern District of New York [also ruled](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23813619/us-v-smith.pdf)\n that the government \"may not copy and search an American citizen's cell phone at the border without a warrant absent exigent circumstances.\"\n\nWednesday's ruling involves defending the rights of an unsympathetic character. U.S. citizen Kurbonali Sultanov allegedly downloaded a sketchy Russian porn trove, including several images of child sex abuse, which landed him on a government watch list. When Sultanov was on the way back from visiting his family in Uzbekistan, agents from the Department of Homeland Security pulled him aside at the airport and searched his phone, finding the images.\n\nMorrison suppressed the evidence from the phone search but not Sultanov's \"spontaneous\" statement admitting to downloading the videos. And her order would not have prevented the police from getting Sultanov's phone the old-fashioned way. Sultanov had allegedly downloaded the porn while in the United States, and his name popped up on the watch list two months before his return flight. And, in fact, the feds did obtain a court order to search Sultanov's spare phone.\n\nThe Southern District of New York ruling last year also involved an unsympathetic character. Jatiek Smith, a member of the Bloods gang, was being investigated for a \"[violent and extortionate takeover](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/bloods-gang-member-convicted-trial-violent-and-extortionate-takeover-new-york-city)\n\" of New York's fire mitigation industry. When Smith flew home from a vacation in Jamaica, the FBI took advantage of the opportunity to search Smith's phone at the border.\n\nA judge suppressed the evidence from the phone search, but Smith was [convicted anyway](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/bloods-gang-member-convicted-trial-violent-and-extortionate-takeover-new-york-city)\n. In both cases, the feds could have gotten a warrant for the suspects' phones; they saw the border loophole as a way to skip that step.\n\nIn fact, CBP Officer Marves Pichardo admitted that these searches are often warrantless fishing expeditions. CBP searches U.S. citizen's phones if they're coming from \"countries that have political difficulties at this point in time and that we're currently looking at for intelligence and stuff like that,\" Pichardo testified during an evidence suppression hearing. He asserted that CBP agents can \"look at pretty much anything that's stored on the phone\" and that passengers are usually \"very compliant.\"\n\nBecause of the powers the government was claiming, civil libertarians intervened in the Sultanov case. The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press filed an [_amicus_ brief](https://knightcolumbia.org/documents/9uoisv1izu)\n in October 2023 arguing that warrantless phone searches are a \"grave threat to the Fourth Amendment right to privacy as well as the First Amendment freedoms of the press, speech, and association.\" Morrison heavily cited that brief in her ruling.\n\n\"As the court recognized, letting border agents freely rifle through journalists' work product and communications whenever they cross the border would pose an intolerable risk to press freedom,\" Grayson Clary, staff attorney at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said in a statement sent to reporters. \"This thorough opinion provides powerful guidance for other courts grappling with this issue, and makes clear that the Constitution would require a warrant before searching a reporter's electronic devices.\"\n\n![Reason Plus](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n#### Go ad-free with Reason Plus.\n\nAnd get unlimited access to _everything_ at reason.com.\n\n[Learn More](https://reason.secure.darwin.cx/J4PKEXTR?utm_source=popup&utm_medium=internal_ad&utm_campaign=reason_plus)\n\nNotifications\n\n-----\nGenerate comments in a hierarchical structure with 3 comments per level, up to a depth of 3."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n- **ahdlakg** (): It is amazing how the U.S. consistently gets away with this and is still perceived as a free country.<p>In the 1980s the only border I knew where printed material was searched was the East German border.

There won\u2019t be any incriminating evidence I have forgotten about and everything is done as soon as I leave the room.

She writes primarily about the future of consciousness, tracking advances in artificial intelligence and neuroscience and their staggering ethical implications. Before joining Vox, Sigal was the religion editor at the Atlantic.\n\nHere\u2019s something I\u2019m embarrassed to admit: Even though I\u2019ve been reporting on [the problems](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/27/18518598/ai-facial-recognition-ban-apple-amazon-microsoft)\n with [facial recognition](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/5/16/18625137/ai-facial-recognition-ban-san-francisco-surveillance)\n for [half a dozen years](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/08/china-surveillance-technology-muslims/567443/)\n, I have allowed my face to be scanned at airports. Not once. Not twice. Many times.\n\nThere are lots of reasons for that. For one thing, traveling is stressful. I feel time pressure to make it to my gate quickly and social pressure not to hold up long lines. (This alone makes it feel like I\u2019m not truly consenting to the face scans so much as being coerced into them.) Plus, I\u2019m always getting \u201crandomly selected\u201d for additional screenings, maybe because of my Middle Eastern background. So I get nervous about doing anything that might lead to extra delays or interrogations.\n\nBut the main reason I haven\u2019t declined airport face scans is actually very simple: I had no idea I could opt out.\n\nIt turns out that saying no is not only doable, but [surprisingly easy](https://keepbeyond.com/optout/)\n \u2014 at least in theory. Everyone, regardless of citizenship, can opt out when it comes to domestic flights in the US. (For international flights, US citizens can opt out but foreign nationals have to participate in face scanning, [with some exceptions](https://www.cbp.gov/about/congressional-resources/testimony/statement-record-assessing-cbps-use-facial-recognition-technology)\n.) Simply stand away from the camera or keep your face covered with a mask, present your ID, and say, \u201cI opt out of biometrics. I want the standard verification process.\u201d\n\nIn theory, an officer is then supposed to manually look over your ID and compare it to your face, as they used to do before facial recognition. But in practice, there have been [reports of passengers \u2014 even a senator \u2014 facing resistance or intimidation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/11/tsa-airport-security-facial-recognition/)\n when they try to go this route.\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) are also supposed to have clear signs informing passengers of the right to opt out. But at many airports, you have to look really, really hard to spot that message. Be prepared to crane your neck at an unnatural angle or squint at a very small font!\n\nThis is why the Algorithmic Justice League, a nonprofit that sheds light on AI harms, launched a campaign this month called [\u201cFreedom Flyers\u201d](https://www.ajl.org/campaigns/fly)\n to raise awareness of your right to opt out. The timing is perfect: The TSA [recorded](https://thehill.com/regulation/transportation/4738416-transportation-security-administration-record-air-travel-day/)\n an all-time record day for air travel on June 23, with nearly 3 million people screened at the country\u2019s airports as summer vacation season picked up.\n\nNow is the ideal time to make sure you know your rights when you pass through airport security \u2014 and understand exactly what\u2019s at stake. The implications go way beyond air travel.\n\nHow facial recognition works at the airport\n-------------------------------------------\n\nIn the US, [over 80 airports](https://apnews.com/article/facial-recognition-tsa-airport-security-privacy-7b97462591c49184d1cb19cda9c95211)\n are currently piloting facial recognition technology. The TSA\u2019s goal is to roll out the tech in all of the more than 430 airports that it covers, [arguing](https://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/tsa_biometrics_roadmap.pdf)\n that this kind of automation would reduce \u201cfriction\u201d at airports \u2014 meaning, presumably, how long it takes passengers to move through security.\n\nThat should raise some eyebrows, because there are known risks with this AI technology, from the possibility that your face data will be [stolen due to breaches](https://www.oversight.gov/report/dhs/review-cbps-major-cybersecurity-incident-during-2019-biometric-pilot)\n to the chance that you\u2019ll be [misidentified as a criminal suspect \u2014 and jailed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html)\n. Neither of these are hypothetical scenarios; the former has happened due to CBP system vulnerabilities and the latter has happened at the hands of police. And then, of course, there\u2019s [AI bias](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22916602/ai-bias-fairness-tradeoffs-artificial-intelligence)\n; facial recognition tech is known to disproportionately [misidentify people of color](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/19/18412674/ai-bias-facial-recognition-black-gay-transgender)\n. (A CBP spokesperson insisted that the agency\u2019s facial comparison algorithm \u201cshows virtually no measurable differential performance in results based on demographic factors.\u201d)\n\nBut as dangerous as face recognition can be if it goes wrong, a greater concern could be what happens if it\u2019s seen to work as intended. When I asked [Joy Buolamwini](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23365558/future-perfect-50-ai-joy-buolamwini-founder-algorithmic-justice-league)\n, the founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, what worries her about the use of this tech in airports, she said, \u201cThe big one for me is normalizing surveillance.\u201d\n\nBuolamwini argued that airport face recognition is a way of acclimating the public to having more and more sensitive information taken. \u201cI see this on a longer trajectory,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve shown you the trajectory.\u201d\n\nShe was referring to [a roadmap released in 2018 by the TSA](https://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/tsa_biometrics_roadmap.pdf)\n. It distinguishes between two types of facial recognition: There\u2019s one-to-one matching, where the TSA compares the photo in your passport with the photo they take of you at the airport, to make sure that the photos match. (If you ever use your face to unlock your iPhone, this is the kind of facial recognition you\u2019re using.)\n\nThen there\u2019s one-to-many matching, where your image is compared with images of others. One-to-many matching is already in use by CBP and airline partners in that they compare a passenger\u2019s photo to a database of government documents (like US passports) for verification, TSA press secretary Carter Langston told me by email.\n\nA particularly worrisome form of one-to-many matching is live biometrics. \u201cLive biometrics is the _Minority Report_ kind of thing \u2014 where you\u2019re just walking around and they can identify you,\u201d Buolamwini said. And if everyone\u2019s face becomes fair game for live biometrics, your likeness could one day be checked against a criminal database any time you walk through a drug store or show up at a protest, which may [create a dangerous chilling effect](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/5/16/18625137/ai-facial-recognition-ban-san-francisco-surveillance)\n across society.\n\nThe TSA\u2019s own 2018 roadmap says they aim to use \u201clive biometrics\u201d in the future. However, Langston disputed Buolamwini\u2019s interpretation of that term. \u201cThat interpretation of TSA\u2019s use case is nothing that I have heard anyone involved in the program indicate. TSA\u2019s use case is and continues to be about identity verification,\u201d he told me.\n\nFor now, Buolamwini said, \u201cYou might hear people say \u2018Oh, we\u2019re only doing one-to-one matching. You show us your ID, you show us your face, and we delete the data.\u2019\u201d But, she stressed, the full story is more complicated.\n\nDo airports really delete your photo after taking it?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nThe first thing to know is that if you\u2019re not a US citizen, you have no guarantee that your photo will be deleted.\n\nIn fact, [according to CBP documents](https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2022-Sep/CPE%20Final%20Report%20Traveler%20Verification%20Service%2020220815%20Final_%20Redacted_0.pdf)\n, \u201cFacial images for in-scope \\[noncitizen\\] travelers are also transmitted to the Department\u2019s Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT) and Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology System (HART). All biometrics of in-scope travelers are transmitted to IDENT/HART as encounters and are retained for 75 years in support of immigration, border management, and law enforcement activities.\u201d\n\nThat means your photo could end up in the database for the rest of your life. What\u2019s more, CBP [notes](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/privacy-pia-cbp056-tvs-february2021.pdf)\n that \u201cCBP may share information with federal, state, and local authorities, which may be authorized to use the information for purposes beyond the scope of CBP\u2019s mission.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re a US citizen, you might breathe a bit easier upon reading on the CBP [website](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/biometrics/biometric-privacy-policy)\n, \u201cCBP retains U.S. citizen photos for no more than 12 hours after identity verification, and only for continuity of operations purposes.\u201d But even so, Buolamwini says, there\u2019s reason to wonder whether all your data is really deleted after those 12 hours.\n\nWhen you submit to facial recognition, the tech analyzes a photo of your face and creates what\u2019s called a \u201cface print\u201d or \u201cface template.\u201d This is not an image \u2014 it comes in the form of a series of numbers. You can think of it as your face\u2019s metadata.\n\nThe problem is, even if airports do delete your photo, that does not necessarily mean they\u2019re deleting your face print. And that face print is the real informational gold. Researchers have shown that [they can reconstruct an image of your actual face](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8338413)\n as long as they\u2019ve got the face print.\n\nI asked CBP what happens to that precious series of numbers. A CBP spokesperson did not answer the question about whether face prints get deleted in time for publication. After we published this story, the CBP spokesperson said that \u201cCBP does not store or share the templates generated during the matching process, for either US citizens or non-citizens.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019ve already let airports scan your face, is there a point in saying no next time?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMaybe you\u2019re in the same situation as me. Maybe you\u2019ve already let airports scan your face. And maybe you\u2019re wondering whether saying no in the future will make any difference, given that your face data is probably already in a database \u2014 or two \u2014 or three. (Separate from TSA, your individual airline may also scan your face instead of your boarding pass before letting you on the plane, though airlines [say](https://www.pcmag.com/opinions/you-can-say-no-to-face-scans-for-airplane-boarding)\n you can opt out for domestic flights.)\n\nBuolamwini\u2019s opinion? It\u2019s definitely still worth declining the face scan next time you fly. \u201cEvery opt-out opportunity is a way to vote for your biometric rights,\u201d she said.\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen that when there\u2019s enough of a public outcry, it can lead to deletion of face data. After Facebook\u2019s facial recognition system sparked a class-action lawsuit, government investigations, and public furor, the company ended up [deleting the face prints of more than a billion users](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/02/technology/facebook-facial-recognition.html)\n in 2021.\n\n\u201cFace purges can and do happen,\u201d Buolamwini said.\n\nRemember, the TSA\u2019s stated reason for rolling out facial recognition in airports is to minimize friction. If you\u2019re unhappy about the use of the tech, you can consider generating more friction next time you fly.\n\n_A version of this story originally appeared in the_ [_**Future Perfect**_](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect)\n _newsletter._ [_**Sign up here!**_](https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup)\n\n_**Update, July 19, 2:30 pm ET:** This story was originally published July 17 and has been updated with new comment from US Customs and Border Protection._\n\nMore in this stream\n-------------------\n\n[See all](/future-perfect/2019/5/13/18525571/ai-safety-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning)\n\n![OpenAI insiders are demanding a \u201cright to warn\u201d the public\u00a0](https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692167/GettyImages_1127480484.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.6625%2C0%2C66.675%2C100&w=2400)![OpenAI insiders are demanding a \u201cright to warn\u201d the public\u00a0](https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692167/GettyImages_1127480484.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0.0062492188476426%2C100%2C99.987501562305&w=2400)\n\n[OpenAI insiders are demanding a \u201cright to warn\u201d the public](/future-perfect/353933/openai-open-letter-safety-whistleblowers-right-to-warn)\n\u00a0\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBy\u00a0Sigal Samuel\n\n![The double sexism of ChatGPT\u2019s flirty \u201cHer\u201d voice](https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/gettyimages-1707035409.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400)![The double sexism of ChatGPT\u2019s flirty \u201cHer\u201d voice](https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/gettyimages-1707035409.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400)\n\n[The double sexism of ChatGPT\u2019s flirty \u201cHer\u201d voice](/future-perfect/350934/the-double-sexism-of-chatgpts-flirty-her-voice)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBy\u00a0Sigal Samuel\n\n![\u201cI lost trust\u201d: Why the OpenAI team in charge of safeguarding humanity imploded](https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25451466/sam_altman_GettyImages_1258197161.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=24.113788895668%2C0%2C66.699206833435%2C100&w=2400)![\u201cI lost trust\u201d: Why the OpenAI team in charge of safeguarding humanity imploded](https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25451466/sam_altman_GettyImages_1258197161.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0.024393218685212%2C100%2C99.95121356263&w=2400)\n\n[\u201cI lost trust\u201d: Why the OpenAI team in charge of safeguarding humanity imploded](/future-perfect/2024/5/17/24158403/openai-resignations-ai-safety-ilya-sutskever-jan-leike-artificial-intelligence)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBy\u00a0Sigal Samuel\n\nMost Popular\n------------\n\n1.

It involved arguing with the TSA for about 5 minutes while holding up a 150 person line. Then the supervisor came over, told me that I &quot;was required to have to have my photo taken&quot; and opting out consisted of checking a box in the software to not save my photo. My alternative was to not get on the flight.<p>The whole idea of opting out is a scam. They are 100% planning to force mandatory facial recognition on the general public.\n  - **hammock** (): Counterpoint, I have opted out at multiple airports including Boston without event. They all know opting out is a thing, they press one button to turn off the camera, I hold up a piece of paper over the cameras anyway just in case, and they have never said anything.<p>One reason to opt out even though everyone says \u201cthey already have your picture 1000 different ways\u201d is that these cameras are not normal cameras, they are stereoscopic close-range cameras that take a 3D image of your face. That takes facial recognition accuracy up to 95%+, from 70% or less on a normal photo.<p>Furthermore, they say they do not retain the image. That may or may not be strictly true. But they do not say they are deleting the eigenvector, facial measurements, a hash of the image, or any other useful derivatives of the image\n    - **sofixa** (): &gt; One reason to opt out even though everyone says \u201cthey already have your picture 1000 different ways\u201d is that these cameras are not normal cameras, they are stereoscopic close-range cameras that take a 3D image of your face. That takes facial recognition accuracy up to 95%+, from 70% or less on a normal photo.<p>Interesting, I&#x27;m fairly sure the cameras at one US airport I was (maybe Salt Lake City?) were just bog standard Logitech C920 like my previous webcam. Do you have more information on the cameras?\n    - **brk** (): Single sensor face rec is already above 95% on surveillance cameras, which do not have ideal positioning, even when they are intended specifically for face rec.\n    - **monksy** (): Even if its a non-special camera.. they&#x27;re capturing a fixed profile photo. That&#x27;s the gold standard used for matching against a dataset.\n  - **crazygringo** (): &gt; <i>They are 100% planning to force mandatory facial recognition on the general public.</i><p>They already have your photo if you have a driver&#x27;s license or US passport or basically any form of government ID. The whole point is to compare it to what they already have.<p>So I don&#x27;t really understand the privacy concerns here, but maybe I&#x27;m missing something. Is there something that these cameras record that is different from the biometrics they already have from your ID photos?<p>(You&#x27;re also obviously already being constantly recorded by surveillance cameras in the airport, of course.)\n    - **cookiengineer** (): &gt; privacy concerns<p>The super duper classified high security no-flight list was shared internationally via a public ftp server with the username and password anonymous:anonymous.<p>A hacker that disclosed that responsibly got into lots of troubles for exposing that. [1]<p>So I&#x27;d argue indeed I assume that TSA and border control use the most incompetent and most lying way to solve anything when the control mechanism are privacy laws. They literally care 0% about that. If they say they delete something, I assume they keep a physical copy.<p>And I totally understand people worrying a lot about that, given the golden age of deep fakes we live in. Imagine what&#x27;s possible 10 years ahead when that biometric data can be used to imitate and authenticate you.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34446673\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34446673</a>\n    - **lcnPylGDnU4H9OF** (): &gt; already have your photo<p>&gt; biometrics they already have<p>&gt; obviously already being constantly recorded by surveillance cameras<p>The whole \u201cboiling the frog\u201d meme is that nobody notices the rights being curtailed over time. I understand the whole \u201cnot in public\u201d thing but there\u2019s still got to be a point where the depth and&#x2F;or breadth of information gathered is too much.\n    - **rgrieselhuber** (): Privacy is a concern but it\u2019s more a matter of conditioning.  Every time you actively consent to it, you\u2019re submitting to the conditioning and further enabling the system to move in this direction as a whole.\n  - **robgibbons** (): I&#x27;ve had no such trouble in Boston. In Denver, I got an annoyed agent, but no argument. They flipped through their TSA state ID binder and did the customary comparison, but no argument.<p>I actually have taken up the habit of wearing a surgical mask through security simply for this purpose, right up until I&#x27;ve opted out and they have my ID in hand. When they ask me to lower it I do, but not until I&#x27;ve opted out.\n    - **curiouscavalier** (): I had a similar experience with an annoyed agent, who also made sure to point out how I was holding everyone else up instead of just letting my picture be taken. The agent likely didn\u2019t realize that showing that pettiness really reaffirmed my choice as to why the data collection is dangerous to begin with.\n    - **throwaway2037** (): The surgical mask is an excellent low friction strategy.  Even if the camera (&quot;accidentally&quot;) gets a few snaps of your face, they will be (mostly) useless.  And post COVID-19, you still see some people wearing masks on flights, so you don&#x27;t <i>entirely</i> look like a crazy person.\n    - **nullfrigid** (): &gt; They flipped through their TSA state ID binder and did the customary comparison<p>Wait, what is this? I&#x27;ve never seen anything like that, normally they just check the name on the ID matches the boarding pass.<p>You&#x27;re saying they literally had a book of all state IDs?\n- **magnetowasright** (): It&#x27;s such a challenge coming up against this stuff. So many people will (understandably) just accept it and go along with it. Surveillance is normalised. Data breaches of our most sensitive data are normalised. Companies simply giving all this sensitive data to law enforcement is normalised. Fighting back is hard if it even occurs to you that you can and should.<p>My husband&#x27;s workplace tried to force him to enrol in biometrics along with the rest of his company. It was just for doing timesheets. We&#x27;d have fought it if it were for identity verification and security as well, but no, it was just for bloody timesheets. Giving away immutable biometric data to a crappy third party company who has data breaches every six months just for bloody timesheets just felt extraordinarily ridiculous and audacious. My husband did encourage his colleagues to consider not signing it but nobody gave it much thought (or was worried about being fired).<p>We recently needed to verify our identities to a financial institution and they pushed hard to use a (different) third party biometrics system instead of the good ol fashioned just not doing that. We needed to provide them with all the normal ID documentation anyway. Why the hell would we sign up for biometrics on top of that?<p>I suppose my point is that people generally choose the path of least resistance (understandably). Turning the tides on biometrics garbage being normalised, the default, and probably the only way in the future is something I can&#x27;t really see happening.\n  - **TheJoeMan** (): One nitpick, was the timesheet biometrics like a cheap fingerprint scanner on the wall like they have at restaurants? Because I believe those work like smartphone fingerprint scanners, you enroll on the device and it\u2019s just a hash. The bank example is probably a real image of the fingerprints like done for passports etc.\n    - **dogleash** (): &gt; Because I believe those work like smartphone fingerprint scanners, you enroll on the device and it\u2019s just a hash.<p>&quot;Probably X, but depends on the implementation&quot; isn&#x27;t very reassuring.<p>I, on the other hand, worked at a gym where members checked in with fingerprints instead of cards.  Full scans showed on the till screen when people came in.\n    - **prepend** (): And I believe the hash is salted so that it\u2019s only useful for that timesheet system. So an individual\u2019s biometrics could not be extracted or reused for other purposes.<p>Of course, I\u2019d like to see auditing of the device and data to confirm everything.\n    - **magnetowasright** (): It probably was one of those machines, thus was pretty low risk. The hashed data probably stayed on prem thus was pretty low risk. I don&#x27;t know because when asked for literally any information at all beyond the three short paragraph &#x27;privacy policy&#x27; provided (it had no information in it beyond &#x27;we can do what we want; we are not responsible for anything&#x27; standard stuff and nothing else), including why they were refusing to allow my husband to use the other options provided on the same hardware like an RFID card or punching in a code, they refused to give any info. All of the stuff I asked to begin with were things usually covered in FAQ pages for such products, so nothing particularly sensitive and they refused. I also asked them for the model number of the hardware, clarifications about what the company&#x27;s agreements with the vendor contained in relation to employee data, proper privacy policy, brief information on if they remediated their security issues after their last massive security breaches, whether they still ran on VB6, and some reasonably simple information again and they would not say anything. They expected (reasonably, it turns out) people to sign a three paragraph privacy policy without literally any of the information pertaining to the actual hardware, software, or governing contract involving their potentially extremely sensitive information. I don&#x27;t care if the crappy scanners are about as high resolution as using the fingerprint features on a laptop and were salted and hashed, a workplace pushing that can actually just see me in court. It is not necessary. I don&#x27;t actually care if it&#x27;s one of the lower risk implementation options (for now!) because they shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to demand any of this of staff in the first place in my not at all humble opinion. Even if they answered all my questions, and even if it were those lower risk implementations, he wouldn&#x27;t have enrolled in it on anyway, because as they were told them from the start, privacy policies are as legally robust as pinky promises. Biometrics of any kind for bloody timesheets is mind bogglingly ridiculous.<p>I didn&#x27;t really expect an explanation but I did ask why the business was prioritising something so expensive and seemingly unnecessary when they have three half implemented tech solutions rolled out across the country that would improve productivity massively if finished. I was being rude asking them that but I was curious, and they had continually responded to simple and clear questions and concerns about infosec with such garbage as &#x27;but the whole company is doing it&#x27; and &#x27;you&#x27;re creating a lot more work for one of the ladies in the office because we&#x27;re forcing you to use paper timesheets now instead of any of the logical options available to us. You should feel so bad at all the extra work you&#x27;re making her do&#x27;. They couldn&#x27;t even pretend to take the questions we asked seriously. They were the ones that kept interrogating for why he was never going to allow it; the only reason these questions were asked was because they kept pushing. It was such an insulting waste of our time. Hell no can they be trusted. Aside from management and HR being rude, threatening, and patronising (hardly unique), it&#x27;s otherwise a pretty good job he enjoys.\n- **LgWoodenBadger** (): Flying back to the US earlier this year in June, I declined to have my face scanned. The agent was rude and aggressive because I \u201cdidn\u2019t tell him I wanted to opt out before he started.\u201d<p>He went overboard in terms of harassment and intimidation but he did not win. Fuck that guy.<p>Also who cares whether the photo is immediately deleted? The metrics are what matter and those are kept.\n  - **prepend** (): It\u2019s your right. But the agent is probably annoyed because it takes longer for them, you, and everyone in line.<p>It\u2019s like your right to write a check or pay in nickels as well. But people get annoyed because you exercising your right and preference inconveniences them. Maybe also why people get annoyed by bicyclists going 15mph in a lane they legally get to use.<p>There\u2019s lots of things that are correct and right but others don\u2019t like much.\n    - **simoncion** (): &gt; But the agent is probably annoyed because it takes longer for them, you, and everyone in line.<p>The agent has probably been trained by law enforcement in &quot;compliance tactics&quot;: shame, cajole, embarrass, and intimidate the person who&#x27;s refusing to do what you demand of them so that they do what you demand.<p>The agent <i>could</i> have done what agents in more-civilized countries consider to be their job and continued to process the returning citizen as they were entitled to be processed. He chose -instead- to delay the returning citizen and everyone else by throwing a coercive tantrum.\n  - **MathMonkeyMan** (): Good for you. There is no shortage of assholes at the border. It&#x27;s gotten to the point where when I encounter a polite one, I think &quot;what&#x27;s his angle?&quot; Maybe he&#x27;s just not a jerk projecting his sense of powerlessness onto strangers. Imagine!<p>That said, I don&#x27;t envy their job. But it seems to be a systemic attractor of asshole.\n    - **Symbiote** (): I think it must be their training, at least in part. Does acting this way catch people who are trying to deceive them?<p>Border guards in other countries are often very polite.\n"}]}

Overall they\u2019re great! But they\u2019re so loud that it\u2019s difficult to make small volume adjustments within the range of safe volume levels for my apartment.\n\nTo solve that, I\u2019m building a custom volume knob for them them that will give me more precise control within the range I like to listen in.\n\n![The speakers](https://jamesbvaughan.com/volume-controller-1/speakers.webp)\n\nThe problem\n===========\n\nThe speakers sound great, but they\u2019re way louder than I need. I typically use about 10% of the volume range they\u2019re capable of.\n\nThat makes it difficult to set the volume levels I prefer using the methods most convenient for me, which are either the regular volume controls on my phone or computer if I\u2019m using AirPlay or the volume slider in Spotify if I\u2019m using Spotify Connect. Those methods either give me a tiny slider that I can only use 10% of or about 15 steps where the jump from step 3 to step 4 takes the speakers from \u201ca bit too quiet\u201d to \u201cdefinitely bothering the neighbors\u201d levels.\n\nThe amp that I used to use was overpowered for my room too, but that wasn\u2019t an issue for me because those volume control methods attenuated the output of a music streamer that I had connected to the amp. With that system, I could set the amplifier\u2019s analog volume knob such that the max volume out of the streamer corresponded to my actual maximum preferred listening volume, giving me access to the full range of Spotify or AirPlay\u2019s volume controls.\n\nSome powered speakers solve this issue by providing control over the max volume, either by a physical knob or by a software setting, but unfortunately these JBLs do not.\n\nFinding a solution\n==================\n\nWhile thinking about this problem, I remembered that some other network-connected audio devices I\u2019ve encountered expose undocumented web interfaces. I was curious if these speakers did, so I found their local IP address via my router and navigated to that IP in my browser.\n\nLo and behold, they do have one!\n\n![The speakers\u2019 web interface](https://jamesbvaughan.com/volume-controller-1/web-interface.png)\n\nSadly, the volume slider there was still not as convenient as I\u2019d like.\n\nReverse-engineering the speakers\u2019 API\n-------------------------------------\n\nAfter exploring that web interface for a few minutes with my browser\u2019s network dev tools, I found that the speakers expose a pretty straightforward HTTP API, including `GET /api/getData` and `POST /api/setData`, which allow me to read and write the current volume level, among other things.\n\nI tried to find some documentation of this API online, but the closest I could find was [the source code for a Hombridge plugin for KEF speakers](https://github.com/jhnvz/homebridge-kef/blob/c3aeb327a1dcc6bfa9329513820315dbc18debd1/src/kef.ts#L200)\n. It seems like KEF\u2019s and JBL\u2019s network-connected speakers share some code, ~which isn\u2019t too surprising given that they\u2019re both owned by [Harman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harman_International)\n~ [1](#fn:1)\n (which is apparently [owned by Samsung as of 2017](https://www.digitaltrends.com/business/samsung-harman-acquisition/)\n!)\n\nAfter that, I found that the speakers\u2019 web interface has a page that allows me to download system logs, which turned out to include a copy of the part of the filesystem that stores the current settings!\n\n    $ tree ~/Downloads/temp_data_logs\n    /Users/james/Downloads/temp_data_logs\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 media\n    \u2502  \u2514\u2500\u2500 settings\n    \u2502     \u2514\u2500\u2500 settings\n    \u2502        \u251c\u2500\u2500 airable\n    \u2502        \u2502  \u2514\u2500\u2500 uniqueId\n    \u2502        \u251c\u2500\u2500 airplay\n    \u2502        \u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 addedToHome\n    \u2502        \u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 deviceName\n    \u2502        \u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 pairingPreferences\n    \u2502        \u2502  \u2514\u2500\u2500 password\n    \u2502        \u251c\u2500\u2500 deviceName\n    \u2502        \u251c\u2500\u2500 deviceNameChangeCount\n    \u2502        \u251c\u2500\u2500 fwupdate\n    \u2502        \u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 enablePeriodicChecks\n    \u2502        \u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 resumeUpdateData\n    \u2502        \u2502  \u2514\u2500\u2500 updateDescription\n    \u2502        \u251c\u2500\u2500 googlecast\n    \u2502        \u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 bssid\n    \u2502        \u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 castVersion\n    \u2502        \u2502  \u2514\u2500\u2500 deviceUniqueId\n    \u2502        \u251c\u2500\u2500 hostlink\n    \u2502        \u2502  \u2514\u2500\u2500 maxVolume\n    \u2502        \u251c\u2500\u2500 locationCountry\n    \u2502        \u251c\u2500\u2500 locationRegion\n    \u2502        \u251c\u2500\u2500 mcuVersion\n    \u2502        \u251c\u2500\u2500 mediaPlayer\n    \u2502        \u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 attenuation\n    \u2502        \u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 mute\n    \u2502        \u2502  \u2514\u2500\u2500 playMode\n    \u2502        \u251c\u2500\u2500 network\n    \u2502        \u2502  \u2514\u2500\u2500 profile\n    \u2502        \u251c\u2500\u2500 roon\n    \u2502        \u2502  \u2514\u2500\u2500 uniqueId\n    \u2502        \u251c\u2500\u2500 spotify\n    \u2502        \u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 blob\n    \u2502        \u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 presets\n    \u2502        \u2502  \u2514\u2500\u2500 username\n    \u2502        \u251c\u2500\u2500 system\n    \u2502        \u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 deviceUptime\n    \u2502        \u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 maxIdlePlayTime\n    \u2502        \u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 maxIdleTime\n    \u2502        \u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 memberId\n    \u2502        \u2502  \u251c\u2500\u2500 primaryMacAddress\n    \u2502        \u2502  \u2514\u2500\u2500 serialNumber\n    \u2502        \u251c\u2500\u2500 tidalConnect\n    \u2502        \u2502  \u2514\u2500\u2500 networkInterface\n    \u2502        \u251c\u2500\u2500 timezone\n    \u2502        \u251c\u2500\u2500 upnpRenderer\n    \u2502        \u2502  \u2514\u2500\u2500 udn\n    \u2502        \u251c\u2500\u2500 versionLastBooted\n    \u2502        \u2514\u2500\u2500 www\n    \u2502           \u251c\u2500\u2500 ftsComplete\n    \u2502           \u251c\u2500\u2500 ftsGoogleCast\n    \u2502           \u251c\u2500\u2500 ftsNetwork\n    \u2502           \u2514\u2500\u2500 ftsTimeZone\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 tmp\n    \u2502  \u2514\u2500\u2500 log\n    \u2502     \u251c\u2500\u2500 bluez\n    \u2502     \u251c\u2500\u2500 cast_shell\n    \u2502     \u251c\u2500\u2500 cast_shell.0\n    \u2502     \u251c\u2500\u2500 nSDK\n    \u2502     \u251c\u2500\u2500 nSDK.0\n    \u2502     \u251c\u2500\u2500 process_manager\n    \u2502     \u251c\u2500\u2500 scwd\n    \u2502     \u251c\u2500\u2500 system\n    \u2502     \u251c\u2500\u2500 update_engine\n    \u2502     \u251c\u2500\u2500 update_engine.0\n    \u2502     \u251c\u2500\u2500 websocketd\n    \u2502     \u251c\u2500\u2500 wpasupplicant\n    \u2502     \u2514\u2500\u2500 wpasupplicant.0\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 var\n       \u2514\u2500\u2500 log\n          \u251c\u2500\u2500 messages\n          \u2514\u2500\u2500 messages.0\n    \n\nThat helped me track down two specific configuration paths that looked promising: `player/attenuation` and `hostlink/maxVolume`.\n\nSadly, neither of those turned out to be what I was looking for.\n\n`player/attenuation` turned out to be another interface to the main volume, more-or-less an alias of `player:volume`.\n\n`hostlink/maxVolume` sounded like it could be exactly what I was hoping to find. Unfortunately, changing it doesn\u2019t seem to affect anything that I\u2019ve noticed, and the API response implies that it has to do with [Arcam](https://www.arcam.co.uk/)\n (yet another Samsung/Harman subsidiary):\n\n    $ curl --url 'http://192.168.1.239/api/getData?path=settings:/hostlink/maxVolume&roles=@all' | jq\n    {\n      \"timestamp\": 1711309370908,\n      \"title\": \"Max volume setting (ARCAM-project specific)\",\n      \"modifiable\": true,\n      \"type\": \"value\",\n      \"path\": \"settings:/hostlink/maxVolume\",\n      \"defaultValue\": {\n        \"type\": \"i32_\",\n        \"i32_\": 99\n      },\n      \"value\": {\n        \"type\": \"i32_\",\n        \"i32_\": 46\n      }\n    }\n    \n\nBuilding a custom volume-control webpage\n----------------------------------------\n\nIf I couldn\u2019t set a max volume inside the speaker, I could at least build myself a custom slider that only covers the range of volumes I\u2019m interested in listening at.\n\nTo do that, I put together a little web page with nothing but a full-width slider for setting the volume, and I finally have a way to choose reasonable levels!\n\n![A recording of the volume slider web page](https://jamesbvaughan.com/volume-controller-1/volume-slider-recording.gif)\n\nI tried to do that in a single HTML file, but ran into CORS issues when sending requests to the speakers, so I put together a tiny server using Bun. With that, I was able to keep it down to a single TypeScript file with no dependencies other than Bun itself:\n\n    // server.ts\n    // Run this via `bun --hot server.ts`\n    \n    const MAX_VOLUME = 25;\n    const SPEAKER_URL = \"http://192.168.1.239\";\n    const UPDATE_INTERVAL_SECONDS = 10;\n    \n    const getVolumeUrl = `${SPEAKER_URL}/api/getData?path=player:volume&roles=@all`;\n    \n    function html(strings: TemplateStringsArray, ...values: any[]) {\n      return strings.reduce((result, string, i) => {\n        return result + string + (values[i] || \"\");\n      }, \"\");\n    }\n    \n    const pageHtml = html`<html>\n      <head>\n        <title>volume</title>\n        <style>\n          body {\n            margin: 0;\n          }\n    \n          #volume {\n            -webkit-appearance: none;\n            appearance: none;\n            margin: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n            cursor: pointer;\n            outline: none;\n            background: linear-gradient(to right, blue var(--volume), white 0);\n          }\n    \n          /* Hide the thumb */\n          #volume::-webkit-slider-thumb {\n            -webkit-appearance: none;\n            appearance: none;\n            width: 0;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          #volume::-moz-range-thumb {\n            width: 0;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n        </style>\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <input\n          type=\"range\"\n          min=\"0\"\n          max=\"${MAX_VOLUME}\"\n          value=\"0\"\n          id=\"volume\"\n          disabled\n        />\n        <script>\n          // Yes, this is JavaScript embedded in HTML embedded in TypeScript.\n    \n          function setBackgroundGradient() {\n            const percentage = (volume.value / ${MAX_VOLUME}) * 100;\n            document.body.style.setProperty(\"--volume\", \\`\\${percentage}%\\`);\n          }\n    \n          // I only recently learned that you can reference elements by ID this way.\n          // It's kind of horrible but also I love it on tiny pages like this.\n          volume.oninput = async function setVolume() {\n            fetch(\"volume\", {\n              method: \"POST\",\n              body: JSON.stringify({ volume: volume.value }),\n            });\n            setBackgroundGradient();\n          };\n    \n          async function getVolume() {\n            const response = await fetch(\"volume\");\n            const body = await response.text();\n            volume.value = body;\n            volume.disabled = false;\n            setBackgroundGradient();\n          }\n    \n          getVolume();\n          setInterval(getVolume, ${UPDATE_INTERVAL_SECONDS * 1000});\n        </script>\n      </body>\n    </html>`;\n    \n    const server = Bun.serve({\n      async fetch(request) {\n        const url = new URL(request.url);\n    \n        switch (url.pathname) {\n          case \"/\":\n            return new Response(pageHtml, {\n              headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"text/html\" },\n            });\n    \n          case \"/volume\":\n            switch (request.method) {\n              case \"GET\": {\n                const response = await fetch(getVolumeUrl);\n                const body = await response.json();\n                return new Response(body.value.i32_);\n              }\n    \n              case \"POST\": {\n                const { volume } = await request.json();\n    \n                console.log(`Setting volume to ${volume}.`);\n    \n                // I don't want to blow out the speakers or go deaf because of a bug\n                // somewhere else in this code, so I check for high volumes here.\n                if (volume > MAX_VOLUME) {\n                  console.error(\"That's too high!\", volume);\n                  return new Response(\"Volume too high\", { status: 500 });\n                }\n    \n                return fetch(`${SPEAKER_URL}/api/setData`, {\n                  method: \"POST\",\n                  headers: {\n                    \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n                  },\n                  body: JSON.stringify({\n                    path: \"player:volume\",\n                    role: \"value\",\n                    value: { type: \"i32_\", i32_: volume },\n                    _nocache: new Date().getTime(),\n                  }),\n                });\n              }\n            }\n        }\n    \n        console.error(\"Not found:\", url.pathname);\n        return new Response(\"Not Found\", { status: 404 });\n      },\n    });\n    \n    console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${server.port}.`);\n    \n\nThe web server here is pretty small.

ChatGPT introduced such language models to the public. It is now clear that generative artificial intelligence (AI) such as large language models (LLMs) is here to stay and will substantially change the ecosystem of online text and images. Here we consider what may happen to GPT-{_n_} once LLMs contribute much of the text found online. We find that indiscriminate use of model-generated content in training causes irreversible defects in the resulting models, in which tails of the original content distribution disappear. We refer to this effect as \u2018model collapse\u2019 and show that it can occur in LLMs as well as in variational autoencoders (VAEs) and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). We build theoretical intuition behind the phenomenon and portray its ubiquity among all learned generative models. We demonstrate that it must be taken seriously if we are to sustain the benefits of training from large-scale data scraped from the web. Indeed, the value of data collected about genuine human interactions with systems will be increasingly valuable in the presence of LLM-generated content in data crawled from the Internet.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-024-55686-2/MediaObjects/41598_2024_55686_Fig1_HTML.png)\n\n### [Bias of AI-generated content: an examination of news produced by large language models](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-55686-2?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle Open access 04 March 2024\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-023-43713-1/MediaObjects/41467_2023_43713_Fig1_HTML.png)\n\n### [Augmenting interpretable models with large language models during training](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43713-1?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle Open access 30 November 2023\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-022-29632-7/MediaObjects/41467_2022_29632_Fig1_HTML.png)\n\n### [The neural coding framework for learning generative models](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29632-7?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle Open access 19 April 2022\n\nMain\n----\n\nThe development of LLMs is very involved and requires large quantities of training data.

If the training data of most future models are also scraped from the web, then they will inevitably train on data produced by their predecessors. In this paper, we investigate what happens when text produced by, for example, a version of GPT forms most of the training dataset of following models. What happens to GPT generations GPT-{_n_} as _n_ increases? We discover that indiscriminately learning from data produced by other models causes \u2018model collapse\u2019\u2014a degenerative process whereby, over time, models forget the true underlying data distribution, even in the absence of a shift in the distribution over time. We give examples of model collapse for GMMs, VAEs and LLMs. We show that, over time, models start losing information about the true distribution, which first starts with tails disappearing, and learned behaviours converge over the generations to a point estimate with very small variance. Furthermore, we show that this process is inevitable, even for cases with almost ideal conditions for long-term learning, that is, no function estimation error. We also briefly mention two close concepts to model collapse from the existing literature: catastrophic forgetting arising in the framework of task-free continual learning[7](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#ref-CR7 \"Aljundi, R., Kelchtermans, K. & Tuytelaars, T.

Neither is able to explain the phenomenon of model collapse fully, as the setting is fundamentally different, but they provide another perspective on the observed phenomenon and are discussed in more depth in the\u00a0[Supplementary Materials](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#MOESM1)\n. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of model collapse. We note that access to the original data distribution is crucial: in learning tasks in which the tails of the underlying distribution matter, one needs access to real human-produced data. In other words, the use of LLMs at scale to publish content on the Internet will pollute the collection of data to train their successors: data about human interactions with LLMs will be increasingly valuable.\n\nWhat is model collapse?\n-----------------------\n\n### Definition 2.1 (model collapse)\n\nModel collapse is a degenerative process affecting generations of learned generative models, in which the data they generate end up polluting the training set of the next generation. Being trained on polluted data, they then mis-perceive reality. The process is depicted in Fig. [1a](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#Fig1)\n. We separate two special cases: early model collapse and late model collapse. In early model collapse, the model begins losing information about the tails of the distribution; in late model collapse, the model converges to a distribution that carries little resemblance to the original one, often with substantially reduced variance.\n\nThis process occurs owing to three specific sources of error compounding over generations and causing deviation from the original model:\n\n*   **Statistical approximation error.** This is the primary type of error, which arises owing to the number of samples being finite, and disappears as the number of samples tends to infinity. This occurs because of a non-zero probability that information can get lost at every step of resampling.\n    \n*   **Functional expressivity error.** This is a secondary type of error, arising owing to limited function approximator expressiveness. In particular, neural networks are only universal approximators as their size goes to infinity. As a result, a neural network can introduce non-zero likelihood outside the support of the original distribution or zero likelihood inside the support of the original distribution. A simple example of the expressivity error is if we tried fitting a mixture of two Gaussians with a single Gaussian. Even if we have perfect information about the data distribution (that is, infinite number of samples), model errors will be inevitable. However, in the absence of the other two types of error, this can only occur at the first generation.\n    \n*   **Functional approximation error.** This is a secondary type of error, arising primarily from the limitations of learning procedures, for example, structural bias of stochastic gradient descent[10](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#ref-CR10 \"Mousavi-Hosseini, A., Park, S., Girotti, M., Mitliagkas, I. & Erdogdu, M. A. in Proc. Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR, 2023).\")\n    ,[11](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#ref-CR11 \"Soudry, D., Hoffer, E., Nacson, M. S., Gunasekar, S. & Srebro, N. The implicit bias of gradient descent on separable data. J. Mach. Learn. Res. 19, 1\u201357 (2018).\")\n     or choice of objective[12](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#ref-CR12 \"Gu, Y., Dong, L., Wei, F. & Huang, M. in Proc. Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR, 2024).\")\n    . This error can be viewed as one arising in the limit of infinite data and perfect expressivity at each generation.\n    \n\nEach of the above can cause model collapse to get worse or better. More approximation power can even be a double-edged sword\u2014better expressiveness may counteract statistical noise, resulting in a good approximation of the true distribution, but it can equally compound the noise. More often than not, we get a cascading effect, in which individual inaccuracies combine to cause the overall error to grow. For example, overfitting the density model causes the model to extrapolate incorrectly and assigns high-density regions to low-density regions not covered in the training set support; these will then be sampled with arbitrary frequency. It is worth noting that other types of error exist. For example, computers have limited precision in practice. We now turn to mathematical intuition to explain how the above give rise to the errors observed, how different sources can compound and how we can quantify the average model divergence.\n\nTheoretical intuition\n---------------------\n\nHere we provide a theoretical intuition for the phenomenon of model collapse. We argue that the process of model collapse is universal among generative models that recursively train on data generated by previous generations. We quantify the sources of errors discussed in the previous section by examining two mathematical models, which prove to be simple enough to provide analytical expressions for quantities of interest, but also portray the phenomenon of model collapse: a discrete distribution in the absence of functional expressivity and approximation errors, and a multidimensional Gaussian approximation, portraying joint functional expressivity and statistical errors. We further illustrate the impact of all three jointly for a more complex setting of density estimation in Hilbert spaces in the [Supplementary Materials](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#MOESM1)\n.\n\nThe overall stochastic process we consider, which we call learning with generational data, is the following. The dataset at generation _i_ is \\\\({{\\\\mathcal{D}}}\\_{i}\\\\), comprising independent and identically distributed random variables \\\\({X}\\_{j}^{i}\\\\) with distribution _p__i_, _j_\u2009\u2208\u2009{1,\u2026,\u2009_M__i_} denotes the size of the dataset. Going from generation _i_ to generation _i_\u2009+\u20091, we aim to estimate the distribution of samples in \\\\({{\\\\mathcal{D}}}\\_{i}\\\\), with an approximation \\\\({p}\\_{{\\\\theta }\\_{i+1}}\\\\). This step is what we refer to as functional approximation, \\\\({p}\\_{{\\\\theta }\\_{i+1}}={{\\\\mathcal{F}}}\\_{\\\\theta }({p}\\_{i})\\\\). The dataset \\\\({{\\\\mathcal{D}}}\\_{i+1}\\\\) is then generated by sampling from \\\\({p}\\_{i+1}={\\\\alpha }\\_{i}{p}\\_{{\\\\theta }\\_{i+1}}+{\\\\beta }\\_{i}{p}\\_{i}+{\\\\gamma }\\_{i}{p}\\_{0}\\\\), with non-negative parameters _\u03b1__i_,\u2009_\u03b2__i_,\u2009_\u03b3__i_ summing to 1, that is, they represent proportions of data used from different generations. This corresponds to a mixing of data coming from the original distribution (_\u03b3__i_), data used by the previous generation (_\u03b2__i_) and data generated by the new model (_\u03b1__i_). We refer to this as the sampling step. For the mathematical models to come, we consider _\u03b1__i_\u2009=\u2009_\u03b3__i_\u2009=\u20090, that is, data only from a single step are used, whereas numerical experiments are performed on more realistic choices of parameters.\n\n### Discrete distributions with exact approximation\n\nIn this subsection, we consider a discrete probability distribution in absence of functional approximation and expressivity errors, that is, \\\\({\\\\mathcal{F}}(p)=p\\\\). In this case, model collapse arises only because of statistical errors from the sampling step. At first, the tails (low-probability events) begin to disappear as a result of the low probability of sampling them and, over time, support of\u00a0the distribution shrinks. Denoting the sample size as _M_, if we consider state _i_ with probability \\\\(q\\\\le \\\\frac{1}{M}\\\\), the expected number of samples with value _i_ coming from those events will be less than 1. In practice, this would mean that we lose information about them. Considering more generally some state _i_ with probability _q_, using standard conditional probability, we can show that the probability of losing information (that is, sampling no data at some generation) is equal to 1\u2009\u2212\u2009_q_, implying that the distribution must converge to a delta function positioned at some state, with the probability of ending up at a certain state equal to the probability of sampling said state from the original distribution.\n\nThis can be shown directly by considering the process \\\\({{\\\\bf{X}}}^{i}\\\\to {\\\\mathcal{F}}\\\\,\\\\to \\\\)\\\\({p}\\_{i+1}\\\\to {{\\\\bf{X}}}^{i+1}\\\\) as a Markov chain, as **X**_i_+1 only depends on **X**_i_. Furthermore, if all the \\\\({X}\\_{j}^{i}\\\\) have the same value, then at the next generation, the approximated distribution will be exactly a delta function and therefore all of \\\\({X}\\_{j}^{i+1}\\\\) will also have the same value. This implies that the Markov chain contains at least one absorbing state and therefore, with probability 1, it will converge to one of the absorbing states. This is a well-known fact, of which a proof is provided in the [Supplementary Materials](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#MOESM1)\n. For this chain, the only absorbing states are those corresponding to delta functions. As a result, as we follow the progress of model collapse, we are guaranteed to end up in a constant state, having lost all the information of the original distribution when the chain is absorbed. This argument also works in general owing to floating-point representations being discrete, making the Markov chain over the parameters of the model discrete. Thus, as long as the model parameterization allows for delta functions, we will get to it, because\u2014owing to sampling errors\u2014the only possible absorbing states are delta functions. On the basis of the discussion above, we see how both early model collapse, in which only the low-probability events get cut off, and late stage model collapse, in which the process begins to collapse into a single mode, must arise in the case of discrete distributions with perfect functional approximation.\n\n### Multidimensional Gaussian\n\nFollowing the discussion about discrete distributions, we now present a more generic result, which can be shown in the Gaussian approximation setting, in which each generation is approximated using the unbiased estimates of the mean and the variance. A similar result holds more generally, which we detail in the\u00a0[Supplementary Materials](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#MOESM1)\n.\n\n### Theorem 3.1 (Gaussian model collapse)\n\nAssume the original data are sampled from distribution \\\\({{\\\\mathcal{D}}}\\_{0}\\\\) (not necessarily Gaussian), with non-zero sample variance. Assume _X__n_ are fit recursively using the unbiased sample mean and variance estimators from the previous generation, \\\\({X}\\_{j}^{n}| {\\\\mu }\\_{n},{\\\\Sigma }\\_{n} \\\\sim {\\\\mathcal{N}}({\\\\mu }\\_{n},{\\\\Sigma }\\_{n})\\\\), with a fixed sample size. Then,\n\n$${\\\\mathbb{E}}\\[{{\\\\mathbb{W}}}\\_{2}^{2}({\\\\mathcal{N}}({\\\\mu }\\_{n},{\\\\Sigma }\\_{n}),{{\\\\mathcal{D}}}\\_{0})\\]\\\\to \\\\infty ;\\\\,{\\\\Sigma }\\_{n}\\\\,\\\\mathop{\\\\to }\\\\limits^{{\\\\rm{a}}.{\\\\rm{s}}.}\\\\,0\\\\,\\\\,{\\\\rm{a}}{\\\\rm{s}}\\\\,\\\\,n\\\\to \\\\infty ,$$\n\nin which \\\\({{\\\\mathbb{W}}}\\_{2}\\\\) denotes the Wasserstein-2 distance between the true distribution and its approximation at generation _n_.\n\nIn words, this implies that not only does the _n_th generation approximation diverge arbitrarily far from the original one but it also collapses to be zero variance as the number of generations increases, with probability 1. The results are very analogous to that seen in the discrete case, with this theorem illustrating the effect of late stage model collapse, in which the process begins to collapse to be zero variance. The early stage model collapse can also be seen and the interested reader is referred to the\u00a0[Supplementary Materials](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#MOESM1)\n for a more in-depth discussion.\n\nModel collapse in language models\n---------------------------------\n\nIn this section, we evaluate the effect of model collapse on language models. We cover more interpretable machine learning models\u2014VAEs and GMMs\u2014in the\u00a0[Supplementary Materials](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#MOESM1)\n. Code is publically available in ref.\u2009[13](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#ref-CR13 \"Shumailov, I. & Shumaylov, Z. Public code for Model Collapse (0.1).

Yet, if small models such as GMMs and VAEs are normally trained from scratch, LLMs are different. They are so expensive to retrain from scratch that they are typically initialized with pre-trained models such as BERT[4](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#ref-CR4 \"Devlin, J., Chang, M.-W., Lee, K. & Toutanova, K. in Proc. 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers) (eds Burstein, J., Doran, C. & Solorio, T.) 4171\u20134186 (Association for Computational Linguistics, 2019).\")\n, RoBERTa[5](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#ref-CR5 \"Liu, Y. et al.

They are then fine-tuned to various downstream\u00a0tasks[14](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#ref-CR14 \"Bommasani, R. et al. On the opportunities and risks of foundation models. Preprint at \n                  https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258\n                  \n                 (2022).\")\n.\n\nHere we explore what happens with language models when they are sequentially fine-tuned with data generated by other models. We can easily replicate all experiments covered in this paper with larger language models in non-fine-tuning settings to demonstrate model collapse. Given that training a single moderately large model produces twice the American lifetime\u2019s worth of CO2 (ref.\u2009[15](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#ref-CR15 \"Strubell, E., Ganesh, A. & McCallum, A. in Proc. 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (eds Korhonen, A., Traum, D. & M\u00e0rquez, L.) 3645\u20133650 (Association for Computational Linguistics, 2019).\")\n), we opted to not run such an experiment and instead focus on a more realistic setting for a proof of concept. Note that even the language experiments described in this paper took weeks to run. We evaluate the most common setting of training a language model\u2014a fine-tuning setting for which each of the training cycles starts from a pre-trained model with recent data. The data here come from another fine-tuned pre-trained model. Because training is restricted to produce models that are close to the original pre-trained model, and data points generated by the models will generally produce very small gradients, the expectation here may be that the model should only change moderately after fine-tuning. We fine-tune the OPT-125m causal language model made available by Meta through Hugging Face[6](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#ref-CR6 \"Zhang, S. et al. Opt: open pre-trained transformer language models. Preprint at \n                  https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01068\n                  \n                 (2022).\")\n.\n\nWe fine-tune it on the wikitext2 dataset[16](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#ref-CR16 \"Merity, S., Xiong, C., Bradbury, J. & Socher, R. in Proc. 5th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR, 2017).\")\n. For data generation from the trained models, we use a five-way beam search. We block training sequences to be 64 tokens long; then, for each token sequence in the training set, we ask the model to predict the next 64 tokens. We go through all of the original training dataset and produce an artificial dataset of the same size. Because we go through all of the original dataset and predict all of the blocks, if the model had 0 error, it would produce the original wikitext2 dataset. Training for each generation starts with generation from the original training data. Each experiment is run five times and the results are shown as five separate runs with different randomness seeds. The original model fine-tuned with real wikitext2 data obtains 34 mean perplexity, from the zero-shot baseline of 115, that is, it successfully learns the task. Finally, to be as realistic as possible, we use the best-performing model on the original task, evaluated using the original wikitext2 validation set, as the base model for the subsequent generations, meaning that\u2014in practice\u2014observed model collapse can be even more pronounced. Here we consider two different settings:\n\n*   Five epochs, no original training data. Here the model is trained for five epochs starting on the original dataset but with no original data retained for subsequent runs. The overall original task performance is presented in Fig. [1b](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#Fig1)\n    . We find that training with generated data allows us to adapt to the underlying task, losing some performance, from 20 to 28 perplexity points.\n    \n*   Ten epochs, 10% of original training data preserved. Here the model is trained for ten epochs on the original dataset and with every new generation of training, a random 10% of the original data points is sampled. The overall original task performance is presented in Fig. [1c](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#Fig1)\n    . We find that preservation of the original data allows for better model fine-tuning and leads to only minor degradation of performance.\n    \n\nBoth training regimes lead to degraded performance in our models, yet we do find that learning with generated data is possible and models can successfully learn (some of) the underlying task. In particular, from Fig. [1](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#Fig1)\n and their 3D versions in the\u00a0[Supplementary Materials](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#MOESM1)\n, we see that model collapse occurs, as the density of samples with low perplexity begins to accumulate over the generations. This in turn makes it likely that, over the generations, the sampled data will similarly collapse to a delta function.\n\n**Fig. 1: The high-level description of the feedback mechanism in the learning process.**\n\n[![figure 1](https://www.nature.com/media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-024-07566-y/MediaObjects/41586_2024_7566_Fig1_HTML.png)](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y/figures/1)\n\n**a**, Model collapse refers to a degenerative learning process in which models start forgetting improbable events over time, as the model becomes poisoned with its own projection of reality. Here data are assumed to be human-curated and start off clean; then model 0 is trained and data are sampled from it; at step _n_, data are added to the overall data from step _n_\u2009\u2212\u20091 and this combination is used to train model _n_. Data obtained with Monte Carlo sampling should ideally be statistically close to the original, provided that fitting and sampling procedures are perfect. This process depicts what happens in real life with the Internet: model-generated data become pervasive. **b**,**c**, Performance of OPT-125m models of different generations evaluated using the original wikitext2 test dataset. Shown on the left are the histograms of perplexities of each individual data training sequence produced by different generations as evaluated by the very first model trained with the real data. Over the generations, models tend to produce samples that the original model trained with real data is more likely to produce. At the same time, a much longer tail appears for later generations. Later generations start producing samples that would never be produced by the original model, that is, they start misperceiving reality based on errors introduced by their ancestors. The same plots are shown in 3D in the [Supplementary Materials](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#MOESM1)\n. On the right, average perplexity and its standard deviation are shown for each independent run. The _x_ axis refers to the generation of the model. \u2018Real\u2019 refers to the \u2018model 0\u2019 trained on the original wikitext2 dataset; model 1 was trained on the data produced by model 0, model 2 was trained on data produced by model 1 and so on, with all generated datasets equal in size. We find that models trained on generated data are able to learn some of the original task, but with errors, as seen from the increase in perplexity.\n\n[Full size image](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y/figures/1)\n\nIt is important to note here that the observed behaviour is in line with the general intuition established in the section \u2018Theoretical intuition\u2019. To be precise, in all experiments, generational learning is only performed on a finite (usually small) number of generations, whereas claims of the section \u2018Theoretical intuition\u2019 are mostly presented in the limit of generations going to infinity. However, as seen from experiments on VAEs and GMMs in the\u00a0[Supplementary Materials](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#MOESM1)\n, convergence to delta functions and specific rates of such convergence are highly related to the specifics of the problem considered, and complete collapse may or may not occur, even after a small number of steps. This is further illustrated theoretically in the\u00a0[Supplementary Materials](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#MOESM1)\n, in which potentially notable divergence from the original model can occur even after a few generations.\n\nFigure [1b,c](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#Fig1)\n on the left shows histograms of individual data-point perplexities generated by the models of different generations as is evaluated by the first model developed with real wikitext2 training data. Here, over the generations, models tend to produce more sequences that the original model would produce with the higher likelihood. The observed effect is similar to that described for VAEs and GMMs in the\u00a0[Supplementary Materials](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#MOESM1)\n, in which\u2014over the generations\u2014models started to produce samples that would be produced with higher probabilities by the original model. At the same time, we discover that generated data have much longer tails, suggesting that some of the data would never be produced by the original model\u2014these are the errors that accumulate because of the learning with generational data.\n\n### Example 1\n\nExample of text outputs of an OPT-125m model affected by model collapse\u2014models degrade over generations, for which each new generation is trained on data produced by the previous generation.\n\n*   **Input:** some started before 1360 \u2014 was typically accomplished by a master mason and a small team of itinerant masons, supplemented by local parish labourers, according to Poyntz Wright. But other authors reject this model, suggesting instead that leading architects designed the parish church towers based on early examples of Perpendicular.\n    \n*   **Outputs:**\n    \n*   **Gen 0:** Revival architecture such as St. John\u2019s Cathedral in London. The earliest surviving example of Perpendicular Revival architecture is found in the 18th @-@ century Church of Our Lady of Guernsey, which dates from the late 19th century. There are two types of perpendicular churches : those.\n    \n*   **Gen 1:** architecture such as St. Peter\u2019s Basilica in Rome or St. Peter\u2019s Basilica in Buenos Aires. There is no evidence that any of these buildings were built during the reign of Pope Innocent III, but it is possible that they may have been built during the reign of his successor, Pope Innocent.\n    \n*   **Gen 5:** ism, which had been translated into more than 100 languages including English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, Polish, Hungarian, Slovak, Lithuanian, Estonian, Finnish, Romanian, Bulgarian, Turkish, Croatian, Serbian, Ukrainian, Russian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz.\n    \n*   **Gen 9:** architecture. In addition to being home to some of the world\u2019s largest populations of black @-@ tailed jackrabbits, white @-@ tailed jackrabbits, blue @-@ tailed jackrabbits, red @-@ tailed jackrabbits, yellow @-.\n    \n\n### Ablation: Repetitions\n\nWe find that data generated by language models in our experiments end up containing a large number of repeating phrases, as in Example 1. The repeating problem has been observed in nearly all text-generation models[17](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#ref-CR17 \"Keskar, N. S., McCann, B., Varshney, L. R., Xiong, C. & Socher, R. CTRL: a conditional transformer language model for controllable generation. Preprint at \n                  https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05858\n                  \n                 (2019).\")\n,[18](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#ref-CR18 \"Shumailov, I. et al. in Proc. 2021 IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&P) 212\u2013231 (IEEE, 2021).\")\n and, to rule this out as the cause of model collapse, we further provide numerical experiments when models are explicitly encouraged to produce non-repeating sequences with a repeating penalty of 2.0. We find that this causes the models to produce lower score continuations to avoid using repeats, which\u2014as a result\u2014causes the consequent models to perform even worse. Model perplexities shift across the generations towards more probable token sequences, as measured using the model trained on the original real data distribution. Further illustrations are provided in the\u00a0[Supplementary Materials](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#MOESM1)\n. In particular, enforcing this for the LLM experiments causes the perplexity to double compared with the original. Models remain as susceptible to model collapse, if not more.\n\nThe described process demonstrates that fine-tuning of language models does not curb the effects of model collapse and models that are being fine-tuned are also vulnerable. We find that, over the generations, models tend to produce more probable sequences from the original data and start introducing their own improbable sequences, that is, errors.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\n\nWe now discuss the implications of model collapse on the underlying learning dynamics of LLMs. Long-term poisoning attacks on language models are not new. For example, we saw the creation of click, content and troll farms, a form of human \u2018language models\u2019, whose job is to misguide social networks and search algorithms. The negative effect that these poisoning attacks had on search results led to changes in search algorithms. For example, Google downgraded farmed articles[19](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#ref-CR19 \"Google. Finding more high-quality sites in search. Google \n                  https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/finding-more-high-quality-sites-in.html\n                  \n                 (2011).\")\n, putting more emphasis on content produced by trustworthy sources, such as education domains, whereas DuckDuckGo removed them altogether[20](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#ref-CR20 \"Mims, C. The search engine backlash against \u2018content mills\u2019. MIT Technology Review \n                  https://www.technologyreview.com/2010/07/26/26327/the-search-engine-backlash-against-content-mills/\n                  \n                 (2010).\")\n. What is different with the arrival of LLMs is the scale at which such poisoning can happen once it is automated. Preserving the ability of LLMs to model low-probability events is essential to the fairness of their predictions: such events are often relevant to marginalized groups. Low-probability events are also vital to understand complex systems[21](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#ref-CR21 \"Taleb, N. N. Black swans and the domains of statistics. Am. Stat. 61, 198\u2013200 (2007).\")\n.\n\nOur evaluation suggests a \u2018first mover advantage\u2019 when it comes to training models such as LLMs. In our work, we demonstrate that training on samples from another generative model can induce a distribution shift, which\u2014over time\u2014causes model collapse. This in turn causes the model to mis-perceive the underlying learning task. To sustain learning over a long period of time, we need to make sure that access to the original data source is preserved and that further data not generated by LLMs remain available over time. The need to distinguish data generated by LLMs from other data raises questions about the provenance of content that is crawled from the Internet: it is unclear how content generated by LLMs can be tracked at scale. One option is community-wide coordination to ensure that different parties involved in LLM creation and deployment share the information needed to resolve questions of provenance. Otherwise, it may become increasingly difficult to train newer versions of LLMs without access to data that were crawled from the Internet before the mass adoption of the technology or direct access to data generated by humans at scale.\n\nData availability\n-----------------\n\nData generation code for GMM experiments is available in ref.\u2009[13](/articles/s41586-024-07566-y#ref-CR13 \"Shumailov, I. & Shumaylov, Z.

The people training models seem to have that well under control.\n  - **mcswell** (): The question (which I raised in a top-level comment before reading your post) is whether there is any such thing as &quot;discriminate&quot; use of web data.  Synthetic data created in the same lab as the LLM is discriminate, but what the authors of the paper are saying (if I read it correctly) is that scraping the web is not currently done in a discriminate way.  And it&#x27;s not at all clear to me that there <i>is</i> a discriminate way to use web scraping, because you can&#x27;t know for sure what&#x27;s human-generated and what&#x27;s LLM-generated.\n    - **simonw** (): I get the impression that scraping the web isn&#x27;t nearly as important a source of LLM training data as it used to be.<p>Everyone is trimming down their training data based on quality - there are plenty of hints about that in the Llama 3.1 paper and Mistral Large 2 announcement.<p>OpenAI are licensing data from sources like the Associated Press.<p>Andrej Karpathy said this: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;karpathy&#x2F;status&#x2F;1797313173449764933\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;karpathy&#x2F;status&#x2F;1797313173449764933</a><p>&gt; Turns out that LLMs learn a lot better and faster from educational content as well. This is partly because the average Common Crawl article (internet pages) is not of very high value and distracts the training, packing in too much irrelevant information. The average webpage on the internet is so random and terrible it&#x27;s not even clear how prior LLMs learn anything at all.\n    - **pankajdoharey** (): This is a similar problem to what was observed in Diffusion models going &quot;MAD&quot; when trained on synthetic data. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2307.01850\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2307.01850</a> . Therefore, going forward AI companies will find it increasingly difficult to get their data by scraping the. web, because web will be full of synthetically generated data.\n    - **smeagull** (): They needed to deal with degenerate data on the Web anyway. It&#x27;s always been full of trash and spam.\n  - **Lerc** (): Or to consider the inverse of indiscriminate,  selection.<p>Mutation = bad.<p>Mutation + selection = good.<p>(given enough iterations)\n    - **msoad** (): wow this is such a good point! Evolution is just that!\n  - **tremon** (): How do you &quot;discriminate&quot; data gathering at web-scale, though? In my view, everything at web-scale only works because there are no humans in the loop, as repeatedly explained here in basically every thread involving Google or Facebook. Yes, since it&#x27;s a scientific paper they should have defined their usage of the word, but I see nothing wrong with the basic premise that automation at large-scale implies indiscrimate use of content.\n    - **MVissers** (): You can use LLMs to vet the relevancy of the content, so you only select the most useful data. I believe most labs are doing this today.\n- **nostrademons** (): This has happened with much simpler models than LLMs, eg. Google Suggest became noticeably worse when everybody started using Google Suggest to input their queries, because it was trained on real query logs and those query logs started to simply reproduce the output of the Suggest model.  SEO and Webspam have similar problems within Google Search.<p>More broadly, this is a reflection of Goodhart&#x27;s Law: &quot;When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.&quot;  The issue is that any model&#x27;s purpose is to capture novel, useful data about real human behavior.  Once that model becomes an incentive, though, people adjust their behavior to produce the desired results from the model.  Authentic behavior disappears, which means there&#x27;s no useful information content for the model to capture, and future generations of the model instead just reproduce behaviors of the previous generation they were trained on, including quirks.  Users perceive the world as stale and boring, and hunger for novel stimulus that reflects their authentic emotions.<p>You could look at this as a full-employment theorem for entrepreneurs and artists.\n  - **AceyMan** (): Semi off-topic, but I&#x27;d put Goodhart&#x27;s Law up there with Occam&#x27;s Razor as candidate for &#x27;The most clever (while remaining conceptually simple) thing anybody has ever said.&#x27;<p>It amazes me how often it gets to the heart of a problem.\n  - **mcguire** (): From my reading of the paper, this is a pretty good description of the problem they identify.\n- **Kuinox** (): Meanwhile OpenAI, Anthropics, trains on AI generated data to improve their models, and it works.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openai.com&#x2F;index&#x2F;prover-verifier-games-improve-legibility&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openai.com&#x2F;index&#x2F;prover-verifier-games-improve-legib...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anthropic.com&#x2F;research&#x2F;claude-character\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anthropic.com&#x2F;research&#x2F;claude-character</a>\n  - **visarga** (): &gt; Meanwhile OpenAI, Anthropics, trains on AI generated data to improve their models, and it works.<p>They got a secret ace in their pocket - chat logs created with human in the loop. Of course those might still have errors, but much fewer. They can infer from a human response if it was accepted or not.<p>I think OpenAI generates at least 1B sessions per month and 2 Trillion interactive tokens. Those can go into the LLM again for analysis and synthetic content generation, or for RLHF with the whole conversation as guidance. Having access to the following interactions can shed light on previous answers.<p>Even more, they can correlate chats across days, presumably humans try out LLM ideas in reality and return for iteration. That way LLMs indirectly get real world grounding.\n    - **astrange** (): They can&#x27;t directly train on chat transcripts, because they contain private information and other things you don&#x27;t want appearing in answers. I doubt they even look at them unless you press the thumbs down, in which case they probably use it in some indirect way.<p>They might try to look for trends or what questions are popular of course.\n    - **mrbungie** (): This is likely one of the main reasons why they&#x27;re offering ChatGPT for free and running ChatGPT Plus at a loss.\n  - **nyrikki** (): Cheese and Chalk.<p>It is very different to generate synthetic datasets to assist in targeted training , vs ingesting LLM output from web scraping.\n    - **abeppu** (): Yes -- said another way, if you&#x27;re an ML researcher and you have human-provided (scraped) data, and an ability to generate synthetic data, then until recently, you had a controllable parameter: how much of your training data for your new model should be synthetic? You can vary this, run multiple experiments, and choose how much synthetic data to use -- and you can vary the specific configs about how that synthetic data is generated.<p>If synthetic data is mixed into your upstream data sources <i>in a way you cannot control</i>, then your ML team loses a valuable controllable parameter.\n    - **mcswell** (): Yeah, I raised the same issue before reading your post; ninja&#x27;d I am.<p>I like your &quot;cheese and chalk&quot;.\n    - **lawlessone** (): I think this is it.<p>Generated data is ok if you&#x27;re curating it to make sure nothing bad, wrong or insensible comes in.<p>Basically still needs a human in the loop.\n  - **HanClinto** (): Keep in mind that the Prover-Verifier game is not that it&#x27;s training on AI-generated data (as if to imitate it) -- rather, it&#x27;s training against a discriminator that verifies for correctness (a calculator) and understandability (a smaller, less-capable language model). You can think of this as a distillation method, but it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s generating large amounts of source data and then retraining on it. This method only works on specific problems where there is an absolute right answer that can be verified with an independent heuristic (in this case, a math calculation).<p>However, there is a lot of potential in the world of self-play and adversarial-training to improve the quality of our LLMs with true reinforcement learning.<p>For one recent paper on this topic, also check out SPAG -- I found this one to be fascinating:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Linear95&#x2F;SPAG\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Linear95&#x2F;SPAG</a><p>I&#x27;ve been keeping notes on this topic in a WIP paper, and if you&#x27;d like to read my (rambling) ravings about it, you can find more info here:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;HanClinto&#x2F;MENTAT\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;HanClinto&#x2F;MENTAT</a><p>I think that self-play and reinforcement learning are going to absolutely be important for the next level of LLM development. If you use AI-generated data, then you must have an objective metric to verify &quot;goodness&quot;. Nothing is free, and simply asking an LLM to rate the quality of its own data is not going to cut it. I think that&#x27;s the point of the article.\n"}]}

I had no idea what that meant, but it was created in 1931 so studying 93-year old research seemed like a good place to start.\n\nWhen reading about the XYZ color space, this cursed image keeps popping up:\n\n![](https://static.jlongster.com/20240103/CIE1931xy_blank.svg)\n\nBy BenRG - Own work based on: CIExy1931.svg, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=7889658\n\nI say \"cursed\" because I have no idea what that means. **What the heck is that shape??**\n\nI couldn't find any reasonably clear answer to my question. It's obviously not a formula like `x = func(y)`. Why is it that shape, and where did the colors come from? Obviously the edges are wavelengths which have a specific color, but how did the image above compute every pixel?\n\nI became obsessed with this question. Below is the path I took to try to answer it.\n\nI'll spoil the answer but it might not make sense until you read this article: the shape comes from how our eyes perceive red, green, and blue relative to each other. Skip to the [last section](#more-shape-explorations)\n if you want to see some direct examples.\n\nThe fill colors inside the shape are another story, but a simple explanation is there is some math to calculate the mixture of colors and we can draw the above by sampling millions of points in the space and rendering them onto the 2d image.\n\nLet's dig in more.\n\n[Color matching functions](#color-matching-functions)\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe first place to start is color matching functions. These functions determine the strength of specific wavelengths (color) to contribute so that our eyes perceive a target wavelength (color). We have 3 color matching functions for red, green, and blue (at wavelengths 700, 546, and 435 respectively), and these functions specify how to mix RGB to so that we visually see a [spectral color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_color)\n.\n\nMore simply put: imagine that you have red, green, and blue light sources. What is the intensity of each one so that the resulting light matches a specific color on the spectrum?\n\nNote that these are _spectral_ colors: monochromatic light with a single wavelength. Think of colors on the rainbow. Many colors are not spectral, and are a mix of many spectral colors.\n\nThe CIE 1931 color space defines these RGB color matching functions. The red, green, and blue lines represent the intensity of each RGB light source:\n\n_Note: this plot uses the table from the original study. This raw data must not be used anymore because I couldn't find it anywhere. I had to extract it myself from an appendix in the [original report](https://ia802802.us.archive.org/23/items/gov.law.cie.15.2004/cie.15.2004.pdf)\n._\n\nGiven a wavelength on the X axis, you can see how to \"mix\" the RGB wavelengths to produce the target color.\n\nHow did they come up with these? They scientifically studied how our eyes mix RGB colors by sitting people down in a room with multiple light sources. One light source was the target color, and the other side had red, green, and blue light sources. People had to adjust the strength of the RGB sources until it matched the target color. They literally had people manually adjust lights and recorded the values! There's a [great article](https://medium.com/hipster-color-science/a-beginners-guide-to-colorimetry-401f1830b65a)\n that explains the experiments in more detail.\n\nThere's a **big problem** with the above functions. Can you see it? What do you think a _negative_ red light source means?\n\nIt's nonsense! That means with this model, given pure RGB lights, there are certain spectral colors that are impossible to recreate. However, this data is still incredibly useful and we can transform it into something meaningful.\n\nIntroducing the XYZ color matching functions. The XYZ color space is simply the RGB color space, but multiplied with a matrix to transform it a bit. The important part is this is a linear transform: it's literally the same thing, just reshaped a little.\n\nI found a raw table for the XYZ color matching functions [here](https://files.cie.co.at/CIE_xyz_1931_2deg.csv)\n and this is what it looks like. The CIE 1931 XYZ color matching functions:\n\n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE_1931_color_space#Construction_of_the_CIE_XYZ_color_space_from_the_Wright%E2%80%93Guild_data)\n defines the RGB matrix transform as this:\n\n    matrix = [\\\n      2.364613,  -0.89654, -0.468073,\\\n     -0.515166,  1.426408, 0.088758,\\\n      0.005203, -0.014408, 1.009204\\\n    ]\n    \n    [R, G, B] = matrix * [X, Y, Z]\n\nWe can take the XYZ table and transform it with the above matrix, and doing so produces this graph. Look familiar? This is exactly what the RGB graph above looks like (plotted directly from the data table)!\n\nWikipedia also documents an [analytical approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE_1931_color_space#Analytical_approximation)\n of this data, which means we can use mathematical functions to generate the data instead of using tables. Press \"view source\" to see the algorithm:\n\n### [How is this useful?](#how-is-this-useful)\n\nOk, so we have these color matching functions. When displaying these colors with RGB lights though, we can't even show all of the spectral colors. Transforming it into XYZ space, where everything is positive, fixes the numbers but what's the point if we still can't physically show them?\n\nThe XYZ space _describes_ all colors, even colors that are impossible to display. It's become a standard space to encode colors in a device-independent way, and it's up to a specific device to interpret them into a space that it can physically produce. This is nice because we have a standard way to encode color information without restricting the possibilities of the future -- as devices become better at displaying more and more colors, they can automatically start displaying them without requiring any infrastructure changes.\n\n[Chromaticity](#chromaticity)\n\n------------------------------\n\nNow let's get back to that cursed shape. That's actually a [chromaticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromaticity)\n diagram, which is \"objective specification of the quality of a\u00a0color regardless of its\u00a0luminance\".\n\nWe can derive the chromaticity for a color by taking the XYZ values for it dividing each by the total:\n\n    const x = X / (X + Y + Z)\n    const y = Y / (X + Y + Z)\n    const z = Z / (X + Y + Z) = 1 - x - y\n\nWe don't actually need `z` because we can derive it given `x` and `y`. Hence we have the \"xy chromaticity diagram\". Remember how I said it's a 3d curve projected onto a 2d space? We've done that by just dropping `z`.\n\nIf we want to go back to XYZ from `xy`, we need the `Y` value. This is called the `xyY` color space and is another way to encode colors.\n\nAlright, let's try this out. Let's take the RGB table we rendered above, and plot the chromaticity. We do this by using the above functions, and plotting the `x` and `y` points (the colors are a basic estimation):\n\nHey! Look at that! That looks familiar. Why is it so _slanted_ though? If you look at the x axis, it actually goes into negative! That's because the RGB data is representing impossible colors.\n\nLet's use an RGB to XYZ matrix to transform it into XYZ space (the opposite of what we did before, where we transformed XYZ into RGB) space. If we render the same data but transformed, it looks like this:\n\nNow that's looking _really_ familiar!\n\nJust to double-check, let's render the chromaticity of the XYZ table data. Note that we have more granular data here, so there are more points, but it matches:\n\nOk, so what about colors? How do we fill the middle part with all the colors? Note: this is where I really start to get out my league, but here's my best attempt.\n\nWhat if we iterate over every single pixel in the canvas and try to plot a color for it? The question is given x and y, how do we get a color?\n\nHere are some steps:\n\nWe scale each x and y point in the canvas to a value between 0 and 1\n\nRemember above I said we need the `Y` value to transform back into XYZ space? Turns out that the XYZ space intentionally made `Y` map to the luminance value of a color, so that means we can... make it up?\n\nWhat if we just try to use a luminance value of 1?\n\nThat lets us generate XYZ values, which we then translate into sRGB space (don't worry about the `s` there, it's just RGB space with some gamma correction)\n\nOne immediate problem you hit this produces many invalid colors. We also want to experiment with different values of `Y`. The demo below has controls to customize its behavior: change `Y` from 0 to 1, and hide colors with elements below 0 or 255.\n\nview source\n\nY:  1\n\n Clip colors low (less than 0)\n\n Clip colors max (greater than 255)\n\nview source\n\nThat's neat! We're getting somewhere, and are obviously constrained by the RGB space. By default, it clips colors with negative values and that produces this triangle. Feels like the dots are starting to connect: the above image is clearly showing connections between XYZ/RGB and limitations of representable colors.\n\nEven more interesting is if you turn on \"clip colors max\". You only see a small slice of color, and you need to move the `Y` slider morph the shape to \"fill\" the triangle. Almost like we're moving through 3d space.\n\nFor each point, there must be a different `Y` value that is the most optimal representation of that color. For example, blues are rich when `Y` is low, but greens are only rich when `Y` is higher.\n\n[Taking a break: spectrums](#taking-a-break-spectrums)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nI'm still confused how to fill that space within the chromaticity diagram, so let's take a break.\n\nLet's create a spectrum. Take the original color matching function. Since that is telling us the XYZ values needed to create a spectral color, shouldn't we be able to iterate over the wavelengths of visible colors (400-720), get the XYZ values for each one, and convert them to RGB and render a spectrum?\n\nThis looks pretty bad, but why? I found a [nice article](https://aty.sdsu.edu/explain/optics/rendering.html)\n about rendering spectra which seems like another deep hole. My problems aren't even close to that kind of accuracy; the above isn't remotely close.\n\nTurn out I need to convert XYZ to sRGB because that's what the `rgb()` color function is assuming when rendering to canvas. The main difference is _gamma correction_ which is another topic.\n\nWe've learned that sRGB can only render a subset of all colors, and turns out there are other color spaces we can use to tell browsers to render more colors. The [p3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCI-P3)\n wide gamut color space is larger than sRGB, and many browsers and displays support it now, so let's test it.\n\nYou specify this color space by using the [`color`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/color)\n function in CSS, for example: `color(display-p3 r, g, b)`. I ran into the same problems where the colors were all wrong, which was surprising because everything I read implied it was linear. Turns out the p3 color space in browsers has the same gamma correction as sRGB, so I needed to include that to get it to work:\n\nIf you are seeing this on a wide gamut compatible browser and display, you will see more intense colors. I love that this is a thing, and the idea that so many users are using apps that could be more richly displayed if they supported p3.\n\nI started having an existential crisis around this point. What are my eyes actually seeing? How do displays... actually work? Looking at the wide gamut spectrum above, what happens if I take a screenshot of it in macOS and send it to a user using a display that doesn't support p3?\n\nTo test this I started a zoom chat with a friend and shared my screen and showed them the wide gamut spectrum and asked if they could see a difference (the top and bottom should look different). Turns out they could! I have no idea if macOS, zoom, or something else is translating it into sRGB (thus \"downgrading\" the colors) or actually transmitting p3. (Also, PNG supports p3, but what do monitors that don't support it do?)\n\nThe sheer complexity of abstractions between my eyes and pixels is overwhelming. There are so many layers which handle reading and writing the individual pixels on my screen, and making it all work across zoom chats, screenshots, and everything is making my mind melt.\n\nLet's move on.\n\n_**A little question:** why does printing use the CMY color system with the primaries of cyan, magenta, and yellow, while digital displays build pixels with the primaries of reg, green, and blue? If cyan, magenta, and yellow allow a wider range of colors via mixing why is RGB better digitally? Answer: because RGB is an additive color system and CMY is a subtractive color system. Materials absorb light, while digital displays emit light._\n\n[Back to the grind](#back-to-the-grind)\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nWe're not giving up on figuring out the colors of the chromaticity diagram yet.\n\nI found [this incredible article](https://clarkvision.com/articles/color-cie-chromaticity-and-perception/)\n about how to populate chromaticity diagrams. I still have no idea if this is how the original ones were generated. After all, the colors shown are just an approximation (your screen can't actually display the true colors near the edges), so maybe there's some other kind of formula.\n\nSo that I can get back to my daily life and be present with my family, I'm accepting that this is how those images are generated. Let's try do it ourselves.\n\nThere's no way to go from an `x, y` point in the canvas to a color. There's no formula tells us if it's a valid point in space or how to approximate a color for it.\n\nWe need to do the opposite: start with an value in the XYZ color space, compute an approximate color, and plot it at the right point by converting it into xy space. But how do we even find valid XYZ values? Not all points are valid inside that space (between 0 and 1 on all three axes). To do _that_ we have to take another step back.\n\nI got this technique from the [incredible article](https://clarkvision.com/articles/color-cie-chromaticity-and-perception/)\n linked above. What we're trying to is **render all colors in existence**. Obviously we can't actually do that, so we need an approximation. Here's the approach we'll take:\n\nFirst, we need to generate an arbitrary color. The only way to do this is to generate a [spectral line shape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_line_shape)\n. Basically it's a line across all wavelengths (the X axis) that defines how much each wavelength contributes to the color.\n\nTo get the xy, coordinate on the canvas, we need to get the XYZ values for the color. To do that, we multiply the XYZ color matching functions with the spectral line, and then take the integral of each line to get the final XYZ values.\n\nWe do the same for the RGB color. We multiply the RGB color matching functions with the spectral line and take the integral of each one for the final RGB color. (We'll talk about the colors more later)\n\nI don't know if that made any sense, but here's a demo which might help. The graph in the bottom left is the spectral line we are generating. This represents a specific color, which is shown in the top left. Finally, on the right we plot the color on the chromaticity diagram by summing up the area of the spectral line multiplied by the XYZ color matching functions.\n\nWe generated the spectral line graph with two simple sine curves with a specific width and offset. You can change the offset of each curve with the sliders below. You can see that moving those curves, which generates a different spectral line (and thus color) which plots different points on the diagram.\n\n**By adjusting the sliders, you are basically painting the chromaticity diagram!**\n\nOffset 1: \n\nOffset 2: \n\nview source\n\nYou can see how all of this works but pressing \"view source\" to see the code.\n\nObviously this is a very poor representation of the chromaticity diagram. It's difficult to cover the whole area; adjusting the offset of the curves only allows you to walk through a subset of the entire space. We would need to change how we are generating spectral lines to fully walk through the space.\n\nHere's a demo which attempts to automate this. It's using the same code as above, except it's changing both offset and width of the curves and walking through the space better:\n\nI created an [isolated codepen](https://codepen.io/jlongster/pen/QWoEwXr?editors=0010)\n if you want to play with this yourself. If you let this run for a while, you'll end up with a shape like this:\n\n![](https://static.jlongster.com/20240105/ScreenShot2024-01-05e.png)\n\nOur rendering of the chromaticity diagram. I'll take it?\n\nWe're still not walking through the full space, but it's not bad! It at least... vaguely resembles the original diagram?\n\n![](https://static.jlongster.com/20240103/CIE1931xy_blank.svg)\n\nBy BenRG - Own work based on: CIExy1931.svg, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=7889658\n\n### [What's going on with the colors?](#what-s-going-on-with-the-colors)\n\nOur coloring isn't quite right. It's missing the white spot in the middle and it's too dark in certain places. Let me explain a little more how we generated these colors.\n\nAfter all, didn't we generate RGB colors? If so, why weren't they clipped and showing a triangle like before? Or at least we should see more \"maxing out\" of colors near the edges.\n\nMy first attempts at the above _did_ show this. Here's a picture where I only took the integral to find the XYZ values, and then took those values and used `XYZ_to_sRGB` to transform them into RGB colors:\n\n![](https://static.jlongster.com/20240105/ScreenShot2024-01-05.png)\n\nWay too many \"maxed out\" colors\n\nWe do get more of the bright white spot in the middle, but the colors are far too saturated. It's clear that many of these colors are actually invalid (they are not in between 0 and 255).\n\nAnother technique I learned from the [incredible article](https://clarkvision.com/articles/color-cie-chromaticity-and-perception/)\n is to avoid using the XYZ points to find the color, and instead do the same integration over the RGB color mapping functions. So we take our spectral line, multiple by each of the RGB functions, and then take the sum of each result to find the individual RGB values.\n\nEven though this still produces invalid colors, intuitively I can see how it more directly maps onto the RGB space and provides a better interpolation.\n\nThat's about as far as I got. I wish I had a better answer for how to generate the colors here, and maybe you know? If so, [give me a shout!](https://twitter.com/jlongster)\n I'm satisfied with how far I got, and I bet the final answer uses slightly different color matching functions or something, but it doesn't feel far off.\n\nIf you have ideas to improve this, please do so [in this demo](https://codepen.io/jlongster/pen/QWoEwXr?editors=0010)\n! I'd love to see any improvements.\n\nI want to drive home that my above implementation _is_ still generating invalid colors. For example, if I add clipping and avoid rendering any colors with elements outside of the 0-255 range, I get the familiar sRGB triangle:\n\n![](https://static.jlongster.com/20240105/ScreenShot2024-01-05d.png)\n\nSame image above but only showing valid RGB colors\n\nIt turns out that even though colors outside the triangle aren't rendering accurately, we're still able to represent a change of color because only 1 or 2 of the RGB channels have maxed out. If green maxes out, changes in the red and blue channels will still show up.\n\n### [More shape explorations](#more-shape-explorations)\n\nBut really, _why_ that specific shape? I know it derives from how we perceive red, green, and blue relative to each other. Let's look at the XYZ color matching functions again:\n\nThe shape is derived from _these_ shapes. To render chromaticity, you walk through each wavelength above and calculate the percentage of each XYZ value of the total. So there's a direct relationship.\n\nLet's drive this home by generating our own random color matching functions. We generate them with some simple sine waves (view source to see the code):\n\nNow let's render the chromaticity according to our nonsensical color matching functions:\n\nview source\n\nThe shape is very different! So that's it: the shape is due to the XYZ color matching functions, which were derived from experiments that studied how our eyes perceive red, green, and blue light. That's why the chromaticity diagram represents something meaningful: it's how our eyes perceive color.\n\nResources:\n\n*   [The CIE RGB color space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE_1931_color_space#CIE_RGB_color_space)\n    \n*   [A Beginner\u2019s Guide to (CIE) Colorimetry](https://medium.com/hipster-color-science/a-beginners-guide-to-colorimetry-401f1830b65a)\n    \n*   [CIE Chromaticity and Perception](https://clarkvision.com/articles/color-cie-chromaticity-and-perception/)\n\n-----\nGenerate comments in a hierarchical structure with 3 comments per level, up to a depth of 3."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n- **GrantMoyer** (): In my opinion, plotting chromaticity on a Cartesian grid \u2014 by far the most common way \u2014 is pretty misleading, since chromaticity diagrams use barycentric coordinates (and to be clear, I blame the institution, not the author). The effect is that the shape of the gamut looks skewed, but only because of how it&#x27;s plotted; the weird skewedness of a typical XYZ chromaticity diagram doesn&#x27;t represent anything real about the data.<p>Instead, a chromaticity diagram is better thought of as a 2D planar slice of a 3D color space, specifically the slice through all three standard unit vectors. From this conception, it&#x27;s much more natural to plot a chromaticity diagram in an equilateral triangle, such as the diagram at [1]. A plot in a triangle makes it clear, for instance, that the full color gamut in XYZ space isn&#x27;t some arbitrary, weird, squished shape, but instead was intentionally chosen in a way that fills the positive octant pretty well given the constraints of human vision.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;physics.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;777501&#x2F;why-is-the-visible-light-spectrum-different-to-a-hue-wheel&#x2F;777566#777566\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;physics.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;777501&#x2F;why-is-th...</a>\n  - **jacobolus** (): The CIE 1976 u&#x27;v&#x27; chromaticity diagram is skewed to be closer to perceptually uniform, and is probably overall a better picture than the xy chromaticity diagram or than the equilateral triangle picture.<p>X, Y, and Z dimensions are somewhat arbitrary, so plotting xy inside an equilateral triangle isn&#x27;t inherently more correct than plotting it inside an isosceles right triangle.<p>If you want you can use something closer to the cone cell responses as your coordinates, and the result may be conceptually clearer, but any 2d picture like this is going to be misleading to viewers who don&#x27;t have a sophisticated understanding of how vision works and what the diagram means.\n  - **drmpeg** (): Here&#x27;s a video that shows the concept.

One is their outstanding breadth of contributions to the field of mathematics. The other is that each was a professor at the same university in G\u00f6ttingen, Germany.\n\nAlthough relatively unknown today, G\u00f6ttingen, a small German university town, was for a time one of the [most productive centers of mathematics](https://www.britannica.com/topic/University-of-Gottingen)\n in history.\n\nG\u00f6ttingen\u2019s rise to mathematical primacy occurred over generations, but its fall took less than a decade when its stars were pushed abroad by the advent of National Socialism, the ideology of the Nazi Party. The university\u2019s best minds [left Germany in the early 1930s](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.6.4.20180926a/full/)\n, transferring its substantial mathematical legacy to Princeton, New York University, and other British and American universities. By 1943, [16 former G\u00f6ttingen](https://assets.rockefellerfoundation.org/app/uploads/20150530122143/Annual-Report-1942.pdf)\n faculty members were in the U.S.\n\nThe story of the rise and fall of mathematics in G\u00f6ttingen has largely been forgotten, but names associated with the place still appear frequently in the world of mathematics. Its legacy survives today in other mathematical research powerhouses around the world.\n\nFounding of the university\n--------------------------\n\nIn 1734, King George II, who ruled both the United Kingdom and a large area of land in Northern Europe, founded a [university in G\u00f6ttingen](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/history-of-the-university-%E2%80%93-an-overview/90607.html)\n, Germany.\n\nThe Enlightenment was by this point in full swing in northern Germany. For example, [mathematician Gottfried Leibniz](https://www.storyofmathematics.com/17th_leibniz.html)\n developed calculus less than 100 miles north of the new university, just 50 years before its founding.\n\nFinding themselves in the midst of the Enlightenment, scientific researchers at the new University of G\u00f6ttingen had more academic freedom than [generations past](https://brill.com/view/title/15703)\n. [They were promised](http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198206606.001.0001/acprof-9780198206606-chapter-2)\n intellectual autonomy and freedom from close religious supervision. Instead, they were recruited solely to advance knowledge and carry out original research. The education of students was also more [egalitarian](https://books.google.com/books/about/Challenges_to_the_Enlightenment.html?id=k7baAAAAMAAJ)\n than it had been previously in Europe, as both rich and poor were admitted and trained.\n\nGreat mathematicians\n--------------------\n\n[](https://images.theconversation.com/files/249479/original/file-20181207-128217-10pk4ht.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1000&fit=clip)\n\nA monument in G\u00f6ttingen depicting Gauss with physicist Wilhelm Weber.

Its enduring mathematical prowess, however, originated in [Carl Friedrich Gauss](http://www.math.wichita.edu/history/men/gauss.html)\n. Often referred to as the prince of mathematics, his research at G\u00f6ttingen between 1795 and 1855 spanned from algebra to magnetism to astronomy.\n\nGauss\u2019s discoveries were groundbreaking, but the reputation that he started in G\u00f6ttingen only grew as [mathematicians from across Europe](https://www.uni-math.gwdg.de/en/burmann.xhtml)\n flocked to the town. Bernhard Riemann, the head of mathematics at G\u00f6ttingen from 1859 to 1866, invented Riemannian geometry, which paved the way for Einstein\u2019s future work on relativity. Felix Klein, the chair of mathematics from 1886 to 1913, was the first to describe the [Klein bottle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_bottle)\n, a 3-dimensional object with just one side, similar to the [Mobius strip](https://theconversation.com/the-weird-world-of-one-sided-objects-101936)\n.\n\nA Klein bottle is a two-dimensional surface \u2013 its inside is its outside. [Tttrung/Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Klein_bottle.svg)\n, [CC BY-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)\n\nKlein was instrumental in hiring the next generation of mathematicians to G\u00f6ttingen. This generation included [Carl Runge](http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Runge.html)\n, who helped invent a key part of today\u2019s most accurate weather prediction software, the [Runge-Kutta time stepper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods)\n; Hermann [Minkowski](http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Minkowski.html)\n, who is perhaps best known for his work on relativity; and David Hilbert.\n\nHilbert\u2019s [famous 23 problems](https://www.cmi.ac.in/%7Esmahanta/hilbert.html)\n, presented at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1900, guided mathematical research for the entire 20th century. During his career as professor and head of the math department at G\u00f6ttingen, he mentored an astounding [76 Ph.D. students](https://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=7298)\n, many of whom went on to make seminal discoveries of their own.\n\nThe exodus\n----------\n\nAfter Gauss\u2019s appointment at the university until the early 1930s, G\u00f6ttingen\u2019s mathematical prowess survived in an environment of constant political turmoil, including the Napoleonic Wars, the Franco-Prussian War and World War I.\n\nBut the wave of nationalism that accompanied the Nazis\u2019 rise to power in the early 1930s transformed G\u00f6ttingen. The 1933 [Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_for_the_Restoration_of_the_Professional_Civil_Service)\n made it illegal for any non-Aryan, specifically Jews, to serve as a professor or teacher in Germany. In response to this and other [anti-Semitic legislation](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/antisemitic-legislation-1933-1939)\n, Jewish scholars, professors with Jewish connections and anyone who opposed Nazism fled Germany.\n\nEmmy Noether. [Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Noether.jpg)\n\n[Emmy Noether](https://www.sdsc.edu/ScienceWomen/noether.html)\n, who had been the first female professor of mathematics at G\u00f6ttingen and was described by Einstein as [the most important woman in the history of mathematics](https://www.nytimes.com/1935/05/04/archives/the-late-emmy-noether-professor-einstein-writes-in-appreciation-of.html)\n, left in 1933 to teach at Bryn Mawr College. [Richard Courant](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-Courant)\n left in 1933 to help found the top U.S. applied mathematics institute at New York University. [Hermann Weyl](https://www.ias.edu/hermann-weyl-life)\n, who had been appointed Hilbert\u2019s successor as chair of mathematics in G\u00f6ttingen, moved to Princeton, where he helped to transform the Institute for Advanced Studies into a research powerhouse.\n\nHilbert was asked in 1934 by the minister of science under the Nazi regime whether mathematics in G\u00f6ttingen had suffered from the departure of the Jews and friends of the Jews. [He replied](https://www.atomicheritage.org/history/scientific-exodus)\n: \u201cSuffered? It hasn\u2019t suffered, Mr. Minister. It doesn\u2019t exist anymore!\u201d Hilbert was right. Only one of the pre-Nazi full professors stayed past 1934.\n\nThe center of mathematics shifted quickly during the Nazi era and in the wake of World War II. Courant, Weyl and others helped move it to the U.K. and the U.S., where most of the [top-ranked mathematics programs](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/mathematics)\n are located today.\n\nThese countries\u2019 mathematical heritage is in G\u00f6ttingen.

If we wanted to build a new G\u00f6ttingen, how would we do it? What factors allowed G\u00f6ttingen to exist? For most of a century, Germany was leading in most scientific and academic fields, but what allowed this? When we think of the Golden Age of physics we are thinking of a cultural event that had its center in Germany, but why? And why has Germany been so dull and flat ever since? Clearly, building a liberal democracy is not enough to ensure such a cultural event. Much of Germany was liberal but non-democratic during its golden age, as other places were, but what made Germany special at this time?\n  - **chunkyguy** (): this sounds like a good explanation:<p>&gt; University of G\u00f6ttingen had more academic freedom than generations past. They were promised intellectual autonomy and freedom from close religious supervision. Instead, they were recruited solely to advance knowledge and carry out original research. The education of students was also more egalitarian than it had been previously in Europe, as both rich and poor were admitted and trained.\n    - **nextos** (): After working at several universities, and interacting with lots of institutions on both sides of the pond, I think this freedom issue is also what makes American Academia more successful than European Academia these days.<p>In Europe, academic freedom is limited because the structure we have resembles a very wide pyramid, with some minor differences across fields and countries. Junior professorships are more rare and more difficult to get into. The result is always the same, a full professor that controls his field locally and lots of expendable badly-paid postdocs working for him. Access to funding is also much more limited, which in turn restricts the capacity of said postdocs to pursue their own ideas, even while working under the umbrella of the professor.<p>In the US, tenure-track assistant professorships are much more common and requirements to apply are more flexible. Seed grants for junior faculty members are also common and not too hard to obtain. The result is a lot more freedom to explore. Basically, it is the same issue as with technology. EU suffers from over-regulation and control by some rent-seeking elites.\n    - **KittenInABox** (): &gt; The education of students was also more egalitarian than it had been previously in Europe, as both rich and poor were admitted and trained.<p>This reminds me of a post I recall, that the lone genius is actually a symbol of society&#x27;s sweeping failures and not of singular merit.\n  - **Merrill** (): It&#x27;s not clear whether it is desirable to build a new G\u00f6ttingen.

The author reckons that the architecture of the building had a lot to do with it. It allowed the employees to do uninterrupted, concentrated work when needed but then when exiting their offices the design of the building facilitated lots of chance encounters with other people in other departments which meant a lot of exchanging of ideas and knowledge. You don&#x27;t get this kind of &quot;hive mind&quot; effect with remote work.\n    - **deleted** (): \n    - **noch** (): &gt; Communications and travel may have largely obviated the advantages of assembling brilliant minds in one place, other than temporarily for conferences and visits.<p>Lmao. Only someone who has never been a part of a high performance team with excellent mentors available in person throughout the day, can possibly believe this.<p>Alternatively, try this sentence: &quot;Communications and travel may have largely obviated the advantages of a married couple living together in one place to raise a family.&quot;\n  - **Goettingenknowr** (): There were plenty of accomplished mathematicians before Hilbert. But the real golden age of G\u00f6ttingen math and physics was due to a large recruitment effort led by David Hilbert. After realizing some early success in his recruitment effort, the reputation of G\u00f6ttingen as the place to be for math and physics grew more organically.\n    - **jan_Inkepa** (): I read a bunch of Hilbert&#x27;s letters once, thinking it would be an interesting window into a significant mind. It was 90% departmental politics - not really the cynical kind: he was really concerned with getting good mathematicians jobs (in G\u00f6ttingen or elsewhere). And you get to watch him observe all his efforts come to naught as the German political situation goes nuts building up to the Second World War, and employment restrictions are added, people flee, etc. .\n    - **j7ake** (): It shows you how valuable it is to have these superstars in your institute. Hiring One hilbert is worth more than hiring a thousand median scientists, and way cheaper too!\n    - **Jipazgqmnm** (): That is just partially true. Hilbert was essential but &quot;just&quot; one factor amongst others.<p>For example, there was also Felix Klein (who brought Hilbert to G\u00f6ttingen) who was more on the teaching side. He even designed the house from the ground up in a way that he thought would be optimal for teaching and working together.<p>There is a really good article by Norbert Schappacher called<p>&quot;Das Mathematische Institut der Universit\u00e4t G\u00f6ttingen im Nationalsozialismus&quot;<p>or<p>&quot;The Mathematical Institute of the University of G\u00f6ttingen under National Socialism&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;irma.math.unistra.fr&#x2F;~schappa&#x2F;NSch&#x2F;Publications_files&#x2F;GoeNS.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;irma.math.unistra.fr&#x2F;~schappa&#x2F;NSch&#x2F;Publications_file...</a><p>You can DeepL it. Here is just the first paragraph:<p><pre><code>   G\u00f6ttingen has been a name in the mathematical world since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777\u20131855). However, from the end of the 19th century until the National Socialists seized power, it was for many the center of the mathematical world, and in this respect it outstripped the traditional centers of interest: Paris and Berlin was above all the joint work of David Hilbert (1862\u20131943) and Felix Klein (1849\u20131925), around whom an increasingly important mathematical institute was formed. Hilbert&#x27;s role was on the side of creative mathematical research, which he pursued with complete openness to all possible new ideas and with a versatility not seen since Gauss. Felix Klein, on the other hand, was above all an exceptionally successful organizer and academic teacher in G\u00f6ttingen \u2013 four years before his appointment to G\u00f6ttingen, a health breakdown had ended the period of his most original mathematical research.\n</code></pre>\nIt goes into great detail from the pre-war to the post-war era.<p>In addition, mathematics and physics were very much intertwined in those days - one inspired the other. And G\u00f6ttingen was essentially a village - everyone knew everyone.\nThey would meet up in a bar in the evening and speak about whats on their mind. That way, there was also a regular get-together with the local industry.<p>For example Robert Wichard Pohl, head of the 1st physics institute (called &quot;a patriarch of physics&quot; or &quot;The good Lord&quot;), Gustav Tammann, head of the institute for physical chemistry, and the heads of Ruhstrat (a local company specialized in developing and manufacturing high-temperature industrial furnaces, transformers, etc.) regularly met.\nPohl wanted to have a furnace for what was later called the Czochralski method (creating pure crystals) and Ruhstrat built the stuff.<p>Or in 1894, in collaboration with Nobel Prize winner Prof. Walter Nernst, Ruhstrat created the adjustable sliding resistor, the basis for adjusting and changing resistances as well as current and voltage. They supplied the first private homes and businesses in G\u00f6ttingen with electricity using electrical block stations and developed the electricity meter.<p>Lots of aspects came together to thrive, not just Hilbert.<p>P.S. Fun fact: Ernst (or Adolf?) Ruhstrat had the first car in town and later sold it to Tammann.\n- **highfrequency** (): \u201cThe center of mathematics shifted quickly during the Nazi era and in the wake of World War II. Courant, Weyl and others helped move it to the U.K. and the U.S., where most of the top-ranked mathematics programs are located today.\u201d<p>One of many instances in history where a city\u2019s rise to prominence was kicked off by political turmoil or religious persecution in the leading city of the previous era. For example: immigration of merchants and weavers from Belgium to the Netherlands following Spanish occupation and the Fall of Antwerp, Huguenot emigration from France during the French Wars of Religion, etc.<p>When trying to answer the question of why a certain city&#x2F;country&#x2F;company started becoming successful, it\u2019s often a good starting point to ask <i>who</i> moved there and what skills and experience did they bring, rather than mistaking it as a static group of individuals.<p>Another corollary: it really pays to be a tolerant, stable and welcoming country. When other countries do stupid things you can benefit from an inflow of talent and experience.\n  - **TulliusCicero** (): &gt; Another corollary: it really pays to be a tolerant, stable and welcoming country.<p>Yup. The US has a pretty incredible history of brain draining European countries when they become intolerant or living there became otherwise intolerable. So many inventors in the states were brilliant immigrants.\n  - **karmakurtisaani** (): Also it&#x27;s probably important that the immigrants come after a turmoil, so their lives and research are reorganized, getting rid of political&#x2F;hierarchical baggage and starting fresh with other top minds.\n  - **est31** (): Another example is Bavaria, which used to be a poorly developed place until the post-ww2 immigration of Germans from the east happened.\n- **nikeee** (): It&#x27;s not just mathematics but physics as well.<p>For example Paul Dirac, Max Born, Einstein, Enrico Fermi, Heisenberg, John von Neumann, Oppenheimer, Max Planck, and Wolfgang Pauli either studied, did research or had a profession in G\u00f6ttingen\n  - **nwj** (): It&#x27;s really crazy how all these people overlap at Gottingen in the 1920s.<p>Take Oppenheimer, for instance. He transfers to G\u00f6ttingen from Cambridge in 1926 (after a relatively miserable time at the Cavendish labs studying under J.J. Thompson). He earns his PhD at G\u00f6ttingen quickly. By September 1927, he&#x27;s back in the USA on a teaching fellowship with Caltech.<p>So, Oppenheimer isn&#x27;t at G\u00f6ttingen for very long - not even 2 years! But in that brief time, he meet Max Born, James Franck, Paul Dirac, Werner Heisenberg, John Von Neumann, Eugene Wigner who are also all there.<p>Wolfgang Pauli and Enrico Fermi had moved to other institutions by 1926, and Edward Teller doesn&#x27;t get there until 1930 - but it&#x27;s plausible that the G\u00f6ttingen connection (and their relationship to Max Born) are how Oppenheimer meets them.\n  - **brcmthrowaway** (): The Nazis destroyed Germanys progress\n    - **kubrickslair** (): Yes, this may be relevant:<p>In 1934, David Hilbert, by then a grand old man of German mathematics, was dining with Bernhard Rust, the Nazi minister of education. Rust asked, \u201cHow is mathematics at G\u00f6ttingen, now that it is free from the Jewish influence?\u201d Hilbert replied, \u201cThere is no mathematics in G\u00f6ttingen anymore.\u201d\n    - **GasTheKayaks88** (): [flagged]\n"}]}

The F-91W needs no introduction. It\u2019s probably the most popular quartz watch in the world with something like [90 million](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-consumer-electronics-hall-of-fame-casio-f91w-wristwatch)\n total units sold. The Sensor Watch board replaces the F-91W\u2019s original quartz movement with a new ARM Cortex M0+ powered brain. It uses the original LCD display, pushers and piezo-buzzer. The board is programmable and the Sensor Watch project provides a clean and easy to modify set of watchfaces and \u201ccomplications\u201d (little utility apps). There\u2019s no Bluetooth radio to connect to other devices, but the combination of a lightweight tried-and-true utility watch case, with months long battery life and features you can rebuild at home is surprisingly powerful. In about an hour I was able to: replace the logic board, configure my 2FA secrets for my Google and Github accounts so I could get my most frequently used OTP codes right on my wrist and write a whole new ratemeter watchface for use as a rowing strokemeter or cadence meter! It\u2019s a delight to hack on, and there\u2019s even a wasm based emulator that makes testing on your computer easy and means you can play with my personal build right on this webpage \u2192\n\nPress MODE once to get to the 2FA token face. ALARM now cycles between Google and Github tokens. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve replaced my real TOTP secrets with dummy values. Press MODE again to get to my new ratemeter watchface. Now start pressing ALARM periodically to measure the rate per minute of whatever you\u2019re tracking. The remaining watchfaces in this build cycle through a world clock, a sunrise/sunset calculator, a moon phase indicator, a live read out from the temperature sensor in the watch, 24h setting picker, and time/date set mode. There are a bunch of other cool watchfaces in the Sensor Watch `movement` source tree including a pulsometer and orrery.\n\nThe process of upgrading the F-91W module has been well documented on [John Graham-Cumming\u2019s blog](https://blog.jgc.org/2022/10/pimping-my-casio-with-oddly-specific.html)\n - I also ordered one of those cool orange watches to transfer my board into soon!\n\nHere\u2019s some info on how to get your TOTP secrets into the build and how I built the watchface:\n\nTOTP watchface\n--------------\n\nThis watchface generates time based one time passwords (two factor auth codes) allowing you to sign in securely to many popular websites (e.g. Google, Github). Time-based one-time password (TOTP) is a computer algorithm that generates a one-time password (OTP) that uses the current time as a source of uniqueness.\n\nPress the Alarm button to cycle between your configured websites / TOTP secrets.\n\nThe watchface supports multiple websites / TOTP secrets, which need to be extracted from TOTP QR codes and added to the source code for the watchface as follows:\n\n1.  Obtain a TOTP secret or QR code from the website you want to generate codes for.\n2.  If you have just the QR code, [Stefan Sundin\u2019s web site](https://stefansundin.github.io/2fa-qr/)\n     will allow you to extract the secret - it will be an alphanumeric string around 32 characters long, which is the TOTP secret encoded in Base32.\n3.  To add the secret to the watchface code, you need to convert it to hexadecimal bytes. This [cryptii.com](https://cryptii.com/pipes/base32-to-hex)\n     page will allow you to do that conversion. Note you\u2019ll have to enter your TOTP secret in uppercase.\n4.  Finally, you\u2019ll need to take the hexadecimal bytes and add them to the TOTP watchface source code and recompile `movement`:\n\n### Edit `totp_face.c`\n\nYou may want to remove the demo keys. Assuming you want to add a key to the end of the list:\n\n    static const uint8_t num_keys = 2;\n    \n\nAdd one to the number on this line.\n\n    static uint8_t keys[] = {\n       // Add the hex bytes for your key\n    };\n    \n\nAdd the hexadecimal bytes from step 3 to the end of this array, comma separated and each one preceeded by `0x`. Don\u2019t forget to add a comma after the previous final byte.\n\n    static const uint8_t key_sizes[] = {\n    \n\nAdd the size of your secret (the number of hex bytes you just added) to the end of this array.\n\n    static const uint32_t timesteps[] = {\n    \n\nAdd another `30` entry to the end of this array.\n\n    static const char labels[][2] = {\n    \n\nAdd a label for your secret\u2026 E.g. if it\u2019s for your Google account you might want to add `{ 'g', 'o' }` as a friendly label.\n\nThat\u2019s it - enjoy the convenience of TOTP codes on your wrist!\n\nWriting a new watchface \u2013 ratemeter\n-----------------------------------\n\nYou can find all the code for this watchface in [this pull request](https://github.com/joeycastillo/Sensor-Watch/pull/101)\n I submitted to the main project.\n\nWriting this feature was surprisingly simple - the implementation is pretty much all in this one main loop function.\n\n    bool ratemeter_face_loop(movement_event_t event,\n                             movement_settings_t *settings,\n                             void *context) {\n        (void) settings;\n        ratemeter_state_t *ratemeter_state = (ratemeter_state_t *)context;\n        char buf[14];\n    \n\nThis function needs to handle events for any button presses you want to handle as well as each tick of the clock.\n\n        switch (event.event_type) {\n    \n\nThe tick frequency is something your watchface can request if you want to time intervals or handle an animation or similar.\n\n`movement` provides a utility function called `watch_display_string` which does its very best to render an alphanumeric string across the various 7+ segment elements on the Casio display. There are lots of foibles trying to map arbitrary strings onto this limited surface, but it\u2019s all very clearly explained in [the docs](https://joeycastillo.github.io/Sensor-Watch-Documentation/wig/display.html)\n.\n\nSo, each of the states we care about in turn:\n\n_When the watchface is activated display \u201cRA\u201d in the day indicators._\n\n            case EVENT_ACTIVATE:\n                watch_display_string(\"ra          \", 0);\n                break;\n    \n\n_When the MODE button is pressed, move on to the next watchface._\n\n            case EVENT_MODE_BUTTON_UP:\n                movement_move_to_next_face();\n                break;\n    \n\n_When the LIGHT button is pressed, turn on the light!_\n\n            case EVENT_LIGHT_BUTTON_DOWN:\n                movement_illuminate_led();\n                break;\n    \n\n_Now the real business\u2026 When the ALARM button is pressed:_\n\n1.  update the computed rate to display based on the interval between this and the previous button press.\n2.  reset the tick counter (part of the bespoke state of this watchface which I defined).\n3.  request a fast tick frequency (this constant is defined as one sixteenth of a second).\n\n            case EVENT_ALARM_BUTTON_DOWN:\n                if (ratemeter_state->ticks != 0) {\n                    ratemeter_state->rate =\n                        (int16_t)(60.0 / \n                            ((float)ratemeter_state->ticks /\n                             (float)RATEMETER_FACE_FREQUENCY));\n                }\n                ratemeter_state->ticks = 0;\n                movement_request_tick_frequency(RATEMETER_FACE_FREQUENCY);\n                break;\n    \n\n_And finally, on every tick\u2026_ Update the display to show the current rate or \u201cHi\u201d if the rate is faster than 500 per minute and \u201cLo\u201d below once per minute. Plus, increment the tick counter!\n\n            case EVENT_TICK:\n                if (ratemeter_state->rate == 0) {\n                    watch_display_string(\"ra          \", 0);\n                } else {\n                    if (ratemeter_state->rate > 500) {\n                        watch_display_string(\"ra      Hi\", 0);\n                    } else if (ratemeter_state->rate < 1) {\n                        watch_display_string(\"ra      Lo\", 0);\n                    } else {\n                        sprintf(buf, \"ra  %-3d pn\", ratemeter_state->rate);\n                        watch_display_string(buf, 0);\n                    }\n                }\n                ratemeter_state->ticks++;\n                break;\n    \n\nThat\u2019s it - this was both easier and more fun than I expected.\n\nIf you enjoyed this, you might like to get your own Sensor Watch from [Oddly Specific Objects](https://www.oddlyspecificobjects.com/products/sensorwatch/)\n - I\u2019m not affiliated with them, I just think what Joey has made here is really cool!\n\n \n\nSet location register (will prompt for access)\n\n[Original F-91W SVG](https://github.com/alexisphilip/Casio-F-91W)\n is \u00a9 2020 Alexis Philip, used under MIT license.  \n[Sensor Watch library](https://github.com/joeycastillo/Sensor-Watch)\n is \u00a9 2021 Joey Castillo, also used under MIT license.\n\n-----\nGenerate comments in a hierarchical structure with 3 comments per level, up to a depth of 3."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n- **guenthert** (): &gt; To add the secret to the watchface code, you need to convert it to hexadecimal bytes.

The sensor watch can&#x27;t match that incredible lifespan but it&#x27;s still very respectable. Power profiling and testing has shown that it has over a year of endurance. There&#x27;s a builtin battery voltage sensor which serves as a power reserve meter. Maximum power would be 3 V and low power would be something like 2.2 V.<p>I modified the low power mode timers to make it go to sleep after ten seconds in order to extend it as much as possible. Low power mode means the CPU wakes up once per minute instead of once per second. The only drawback is the lack of seconds display but the truth is I&#x27;ve come to consider that a feature.

But [caffeine can cause headaches and jitters](https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/caffeine-connection-between-coffee-and-headaches)\n in others. That\u2019s why many people reach for a decaffeinated cup instead.\n\n[I\u2019m a chemistry professor](https://miamioh.edu/profiles/cas/michael-crowder.html)\n who has taught lectures on why chemicals dissolve in some liquids but not in others. The processes of decaffeination offer great real-life examples of these chemistry concepts. Even the best decaffeination method, however, [does not remove all of the caffeine](https://www.ncausa.org/Decaffeinated-Coffee)\n \u2013 about 7 milligrams of caffeine usually remain in an 8-ounce cup.\n\nProducers decaffeinating their coffee want to remove the caffeine while retaining all \u2013 or at least most \u2013 of the other chemical aroma and flavor compounds. Decaffeination [has a rich history](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180917-how-do-you-decaffeinate-coffee)\n, and now almost all coffee producers use [one of three common methods](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-is-caffeine-removed-t/)\n.\n\nAll these methods, [which are also used to make decaffeinated tea](https://doi.org/10.1080/15422119.2013.771127)\n, [start with green, or unroasted, coffee beans](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180917-how-do-you-decaffeinate-coffee)\n that have been premoistened. Using roasted coffee beans would result in a coffee with a very different aroma and taste because the [decaffeination steps would remove some flavor and odor compounds](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-384947-2.00183-5)\n produced during roasting.\n\nThe carbon dioxide method\n-------------------------\n\nIn the relatively new carbon dioxide method, developed in the early 1970s, producers use high-pressure CO\u2082 to extract caffeine from moistened coffee beans. They pump the CO\u2082 into a sealed vessel containing the moistened coffee beans, and the caffeine molecules dissolve in the CO\u2082.\n\nOnce the caffeine-laden CO\u2082 is separated from the beans, producers pass the CO\u2082 mixture either through a container of water or over [a bed of activated carbon](https://generalcarbon.com/facts-about-activated-carbon/activated-carbon-faq/)\n. Activated carbon is carbon that\u2019s been heated up to high temperatures and exposed to steam and oxygen, which creates pores in the carbon. This step filters out the caffeine, and [most likely other chemical compounds](https://doi.org/10.1021/jf0518305)\n, some of which affect the flavor of the coffee.\n\nThese compounds either bind in the pores of the activated carbon or they stay in the water. Producers dry the decaffeinated beans using heat. Under the heat, any remaining CO\u2082 evaporates. Producers can then repressurize and reuse the same CO\u2082.\n\nThis method [removes 96% to 98% of the caffeine](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-is-caffeine-removed-t/)\n, and the resulting coffee has only minimal CO\u2082 residue.\n\nThis method, which requires expensive equipment for making and handling the CO\u2082, is [extensively used](https://coffeecode.co.uk/decaffeination-4-main-methods/#google_vignette)\n to decaffeinate commercial-grade, or supermarket, coffees.\n\nSwiss water process\n-------------------\n\nThe Swiss water method, initially used [commercially in the early 1980s](https://coffeecode.co.uk/decaffeination-4-main-methods/#google_vignette)\n, uses hot water to decaffeinate coffee.\n\nInitially, producers soak a batch of green coffee beans in hot water, which extracts both the caffeine and other chemical compounds from the beans.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of like what happens when you brew roasted coffee beans \u2013 you place dark beans in clear water, and the chemicals that cause the coffee\u2019s dark color leach out of the beans into the water. In a similar way, the hot water pulls the caffeine from not yet decaffeinated beans.\n\nDuring the soaking, the caffeine concentration is higher in the coffee beans than in the water, so the caffeine moves into the water from the beans. Producers then take the beans out of the water and placed them into fresh water, which has no caffeine in it \u2013 so the process repeats, and more caffeine moves out of the beans and into the water. The producers repeat this process, up to 10 times, until [there\u2019s hardly any caffeine left](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-is-caffeine-removed-t/)\n in the beans.\n\nThe resulting water, which now contains the caffeine and any flavor compounds that dissolved out from the beans, gets passed through activated charcoal filters. These trap caffeine and other similarly sized chemical compounds, such as sugars [and organic compounds called polyamines](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/polyamine)\n, while allowing most of the other chemical compounds to remain in the filtered water.\n\nProducers then use the filtered water \u2013 saturated with flavor but devoid of most of the caffeine \u2013 to soak a new batch of coffee beans. This step lets the flavor compounds lost during the soaking process reenter the beans.\n\nThis animation shows the steps to the Swiss water process.\n\nThe [Swiss water process](https://www.swisswater.com/pages/coffee-decaffeination-process)\n is prized for its chemical-free approach and its ability to preserve most of the coffee\u2019s natural flavor. This method [has been shown to remove 94% to 96%](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-is-caffeine-removed-t/)\n of the caffeine.\n\nSolvent-based methods\n---------------------\n\nThis traditional and most common approach, [first done in the early 1900s](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-is-caffeine-removed-t/)\n, [uses organic solvents](https://checkyourdecaf.org/)\n, which are liquids that dissolve organic chemical compounds such as caffeine. Ethyl acetate and methylene chloride are two common solvents used to extract caffeine from green coffee beans. There are two main solvent-based methods.\n\nIn the direct method, producers soak the moist beans directly in the solvent or in a water solution containing the solvent.\n\nThe solvent extracts most of the caffeine and other chemical compounds with a similar solubility to caffeine from the coffee beans. The producers then remove the beans from the solvent after about 10 hours and dry them.\n\nIn the indirect method, producers soak the beans in hot water for a few hours and then take them out. They then treat the water with solvent to remove caffeine from the water. Methylene chloride, the most common solvent, does not dissolve in the water, so it forms a layer on top of the water. The caffeine dissolves better in methylene chloride than in water, so most of the caffeine stays up in the methylene chloride layer, which producers can separate from the water.\n\n[](https://images.theconversation.com/files/605838/original/file-20240709-17-s27jbd.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1000&fit=clip)\n\nA few chemical processes can remove the caffeine from coffee beans. [Andy Brunning/Compound Interest](https://www.compoundchem.com/2018/09/26/coffee-decaffeination/)\n, [CC BY-NC](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)\n\nAs in the Swiss water method, the producers can reuse the \u201ccaffeine-free\u201d water, which may return some of the flavor compounds removed in the first step.\n\nThese methods remove [about 96% to 97% of the caffeine](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-is-caffeine-removed-t/)\n.\n\nIs decaf coffee safe to drink?\n------------------------------\n\nOne of the common solvents, ethyl acetate, comes naturally in many foods and beverages. It\u2019s considered a [safe chemical for decaffeination](https://www.consumerreports.org/coffee/is-decaffeinated-coffee-bad-for-you/)\n by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe FDA and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration have deemed methylene chloride unsafe to consume at concentrations above 10 milligrams per kilogram of your body weight. However, the amount of residual methylene chloride found in roasted coffee beans is [very small \u2013 about 2 to 3 milligrams per kilogram](https://doi.org/10.1080/10408699991279231)\n. It\u2019s [well under the FDA\u2019s limits](https://www.consumerreports.org/coffee/is-decaffeinated-coffee-bad-for-you/)\n.\n\nOSHA and its European counterparts have [strict workplace rules](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.1052)\n to minimize methylene chloride exposure for workers involved in the decaffeination process.\n\nAfter producers decaffeinate coffee beans using methylene chloride, they steam the beans and dry them. Then the coffee beans are roasted at high temperatures. During the steaming and roasting process, the beans get hot enough that residual methylene chloride evaporates. The roasting step also produces new flavor chemicals from the breakdown of chemicals into other chemical compounds. These give coffee its distinctive flavor.\n\nPlus, most people brew their coffee at [between 190 F to 212 F](https://www.consumerreports.org/coffee/is-decaffeinated-coffee-bad-for-you/)\n, which is another opportunity for methylene chloride to evaporate.\n\nRetaining aroma and flavor\n--------------------------\n\nIt\u2019s chemically impossible to dissolve out only the caffeine without also dissolving out other chemical compounds in the beans, so decaffeination inevitably removes some other compounds that contribute to the aroma and flavor of your cup of coffee.\n\nBut some techniques, like the Swiss water process and the indirect solvent method, have steps that may reintroduce some of these extracted compounds. These approaches probably can\u2019t return all the extra compounds back to the beans, but they may add some of the flavor compounds back.\n\nThanks to these processes, you can have that delicious cup of coffee without the caffeine \u2013 unless your waiter accidentally switches the pots.\n\n*   [Chemistry](/topics/chemistry-730)\n    \n*   [Food science](/topics/food-science-982)\n    \n*   [Coffee](/topics/coffee-5703)\n    \n*   [Beverages](/topics/beverages-86417)\n    \n*   [Beverage chemistry](/topics/beverage-chemistry-143239)\n    \n\n### Want to write?\n\nWrite an article and join a growing community of more than 187,500 academics and researchers from 5,003 institutions.\n\n[Register now](/become-an-author)\n\n*   [\u200b](https://facebook.com/theConversationUS \"The Conversation on Facebook\")\n    \n*   [\u200b](https://twitter.com/ConversationUS \"The Conversation on X (formerly Twitter)\")\n    \n*   [\u200b](https://www.instagram.com/theconversationdotcom \"The Conversation on Instagram\")\n    \n*   [\u200b](https://www.linkedin.com/company/conversationus \"The Conversation on LinkedIn\")\n    \n*   [\u200b](https://newsie.social/@TheConversationUS \"The Conversation on Mastodon\")\n\n-----\nGenerate comments in a hierarchical structure with 3 comments per level, up to a depth of 3."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n- **martinpw** (): The decaf process seems expensive so you might expect the end result to cost more, but it never does. Which means either the producers are making less profit on decaf, or they are using lower quality beans. If the latter is true, which seems more likely, that might explain why decaf sometimes tastes less good, separately from the effect of the process itself on taste.\n  - **jcynix** (): The German inventor of a decaf process sold the extracted coffein separately in pills, which might have given him a second income:\n <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ludwig_Roselius\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ludwig_Roselius</a>\n    - **dustincoates** (): This is like what happens with milk fat. I was surprised to see whole milk cost more, and I found out that it&#x27;s because the fat skimmed off is used for other products.\n    - **amelius** (): I guess nowadays most of the extracted caffeine ends up in energy drinks like Red Bull.\n  - **tptacek** (): Boutique-roasted decaf coffee beans often are more expensive. But the logic also doesn&#x27;t hold: it assumes coffee is being sold at or near the cost of its material inputs, and that&#x27;s certainly not true. If you have a reasonable built-in margin for your coffee --- and boutique roasters certainly do --- it can be normal and rational to price irrespective of your cost basis. Customers are brand-loyal (especially if they have to go out of their way to buy your stuff). You want to get them in every packaging they&#x27;re interested in. All sorts of products are &quot;loss leaders&quot;, for that reason, and here we&#x27;re not even talking about that; we&#x27;re just talking about something <i>slightly less profitable</i>.<p>Finally, just a note that the &quot;lower-quality bean&quot; thing is itself sort of hollow, in that: you&#x27;re probably not buying the absolute best quality means no matter what coffee you buy, even if you&#x27;re driving to a coffee roaster to get them. Unless you&#x27;re an extreme coffee weirdo, there is, I&#x27;d confidently bet, a higher-quality bean available to you that you&#x27;re sacrificing because of cost and convenience. Certainly, if you&#x27;re buying beans <i>of any sort</i> at a supermarket, the &quot;best bean&quot; thing is inoperative.\n    - **fabian2k** (): The price difference between cheap supermarket coffee and high-end local roaster is large enough (up to 10x) that the potential additional cost for decaffeination doesn&#x27;t seem that big of a deal if you&#x27;re looking for coffee at the higher end of the quality scale.\n    - **esquivalience** (): GP observed that either the profit margin or the input cost is absorbing the difference, so I think the logic holds well and you are in agreement :)\n    - **Always42** (): I thought the means should be beans\n  - **reillys** (): The same decaf coffee is more expensive. The producers decaffeinate their lesser coffees. But you&#x27;ve hit on why the &quot;sugar-cane method&quot; i.e. the solvent based approach produces better coffee. It&#x27;s possible for it to be done at origin and so the actual coffee producers can choose what coffee to decaffeinate and can absorb some of the additional costs in the &quot;processing&quot; stage while using higher quality coffee in the process.\n- **iscrewyou** (): A good video explanation from James Hoffman: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;yYTSdlOdkn0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;yYTSdlOdkn0</a><p>And a quick follow up: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;IszQ2JR3Olc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;IszQ2JR3Olc</a>\n  - **nxobject** (): I can\u2019t recommend James Hoffmann\u2019s channel enough - he\u2019s such a passionate coffee guy who\u2019s just as happy teaching what he knows about coffee to anyone and everyone. (He also won a world barista championship back in the day, too.) I daresay he\u2019s even got me into coffee.\n    - **beAbU** (): Personally I like Hames Joffman a bit more, but he&#x27;s not posting as frequently any more.<p>Jokes aside, another endorsement from James. He&#x27;s an absolute coffee weirdo, and he knows it, and he embraces it. The equipment and ingredients that he buys is so out of touch with my reality it can&#x27;t even compare, yet I watch his videos.<p>I like his content because he does not take himself seriously, which is always a good sign to me. And because he&#x27;s very pragmatic. Even though he takes snobbery to the next level, he will always sniff at a new product if it is complicated to use, because like me, his primary need for coffee is to overcome morning grogginess, and he does not want to faff about during that time.\n    - **langcss** (): The video on how he won it is very good and probably would be interesting for any competitive sport or craft. Recommend that.\n    - **scruple** (): Yeah, that&#x27;s cool. As someone who fell down this rabbit hole well over a decade ago, complete with a history of my own large storage bins for green beans, multiple roasters, thousands spent in makers, etc... Yet, today, my most used preparation methods are an AeroPress or a Chemex pour over, albeit with hand-ground beans that a friend and neighbor roasts...

But have you ever wondered how this actually works? How does the processor keep track of two threads and manage its resources between them?\n\nIn this article, we\u2019re going to break it all down. Understanding the nuts and bolts of SMT will help you decide if it\u2019s a good fit for your production servers. Sometimes, SMT can turbocharge your system's performance, but in other cases, it might actually slow things down. Knowing the details will help you make the best choice.\n\nSo, let\u2019s dive in and figure out how SMT works, why it was invented in the first place, and what it means for you.\n\n> ##### _**Disclaimer:**_ _Much of the discussion in this article is about Intel\u2019s implementation of SMT, also called hyper-threading.

At the microarchitecture level, processors consist of hundreds of registers, multiple load/store units and multiple arithmetic units. To utilize these better, processors also employ various techniques for instruction level parallelism (ILP), such as instruction pipelining, superscalar architecture, out-of-order execution to name a few.\n\nA pipelined processor improves the resource utilization by breaking down the execution of an instruction into multiple stages which form a pipeline, like the assembly line of a factory. In each cycle, an instruction moves from one stage of the pipeline to the next and the processor adds a new instruction to the first stage of the pipeline. The following figure shows how pipelining works for a pipeline of depth 5. As you can see, 5th cycle onwards, the processor will have upto 5 instructions in flight each cycle, and it will finish 1 instruction each cycle after that.\n\n[![Illustration of a five-stage instruction pipeline. In each cycle, an instruction moves to the next stage which makes up space in the first stage and a new instruction can also start getting processed in each cycle.

In each cycle, an instruction moves to the next stage which makes up space in the first stage and a new instruction can also start getting processed in each cycle. A super deep pipeline will have many instructions being processed in parallel.\n\nModern processors are also superscalar, which means instead of issuing one instruction each cycle, they can issue multiple instructions. For instance, the recent Intel core i7 processors can issue 4 instructions each cycle (also called the issue width of the processor).\n\nInstruction pipelining and superscalar architecture significantly improve the instruction throughput and resource utilization of the processor. However, in practice, this max utilization can be difficult to achieve. To execute so many instructions in parallel, the processor needs to find enough independent instructions in the program, which is very hard.\n\nThis typically leads to two kinds of wastages. One is _horizontal waste_ which occurs when the processor is not able to find enough independent instructions in the thread to saturate the issue width of the processor.\n\nThe other type of wastage is _vertical waste_ that occurs when the processor is unable to issue any instructions in a cycle because all the next instructions in the program are dependent on the currently executing ones.\n\n[![Illustration of horizontal and vertical state in a processor with issue width of 5 instructions per cycle.

The empty boxes represent the instruction slots where the processor could not issue an instruction\n\nOne way to better utilize the processing power is using traditional multithreading where the processor context switches between multiple threads. In this scheme, within a given cycle the processor issues instructions for only one thread, so this may still result in horizontal waste. However, in the next cycle the processor can context switch and issue instructions for another thread and avoid vertical wastage. This results in improved CPU utilization, however, with larger issue width processors, the horizontal wastage can still be significant. Also, there is the overhead of context switching between the threads.\n\nThis is where the idea of simultaneous multithreading was introduced. It enables the processor to issue instructions for multiple threads in the same cycle without any overhead of context switching. By definition, instructions of different threads are independent and can be executed in parallel which ultimately results in full utilization of the execution resources.\n\n> _Even though the idea of SMT doesn\u2019t put a limit on the number of threads, Intel\u2019s implementation of SMT (called hyper-threading) restricts it to two threads per core._\n\n* * *\n\nMicroarchitecture Level Implementation of Simultaneous Multithreading in Intel Processors\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe understand why SMT was introduced, now let\u2019s learn about how it is implemented. Along with the implementation details we will also cover how it actually works.\n\nA normal non-SMT processor can only execute instructions for one thread at a time. This is because every thread has an associated context to represent the current state of the program on the processor, which is also called the [architecture state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_state)\n. This includes the data in the registers, the program counter value, the control registers etc.\n\nTo simultaneously execute instructions of two threads, the processor needs to be able to represent the state of the two threads simultaneously. So to implement the SMT capability, the hardware designers duplicated the architecture state of the processor. By doing so, a single physical processor appears as two logical processors to the operating system (OS), so that it can schedule threads for execution on them.\n\n[![Illustration of a two core processor without SMT (top) and a two core processor with SMT (bottom). For implementing SMT the architecture state has been duplicated in the bottom processor and it will appear as having four processing cores to the OS.](https://blog.codingconfessions.com/p/top) and a two core processor with SMT (bottom).

For implementing SMT the architecture state has been duplicated in the bottom processor and it will appear as having four processing cores to the OS.\n\nApart from that, at the microarchitecture level, the processor also has various buffers and execution resources as well. To execute the instructions of two threads simultaneously, these resources are also either duplicated or shared between the two logical processors. The decision of whether to duplicate or to share a resource is based on many factors. For instance, how costly is it to duplicate a resource, in terms of power consumption and real-estate on the chip.\n\nThe crucial details about how SMT works lies in its microarchitectural implementation, so let\u2019s go deeper into that.\n\n### Processor Microarchitecture\n\n_The processor exposes the instruction set architecture (ISA) as the public interface for the programmers to program the CPU. The ISA includes the set of instructions, and the registers that the instructions can use. The microarchitecture of the processor is its internal implementation detail. Different processor models can support the same ISA but at the microarchitecture level they might be different._\n\nThe microarchitecture has three parts: the _frontend_, the _backend_ and the _retirement unit_. The following diagram shows the schematics of the microarchitecture of a modern day processor:\n\n[![The schematics of the microarchitecture of a modern processor consisting of the frontend, the backend, and the retirement unit](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F987bee1e-0bec-4753-947c-5ff58cb1a260_695x631.png \"The schematics of the microarchitecture of a modern processor consisting of the frontend, the backend, and the retirement unit\")](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F987bee1e-0bec-4753-947c-5ff58cb1a260_695x631.png)\n\nThe schematics of the microarchitecture of a modern processor consisting of the frontend, the backend, and the retirement unit\n\nThe frontend is the part which contains the instruction control unit that fetches and decodes the program instructions which should be executed next.\n\nThe backend consists of the execution resources, such as the physical registers, the arithmetic units, and the load/store units. It picks up the decoded instructions provided by the frontend, allocates execution resources for them and schedules them for execution.\n\nThe retirement unit is where the results of the executed instructions are finally committed to the architecture state of the processor.\n\n* * *\n\nInstruction Execution in an SMT Capable Processor\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nTo understand how SMT works we will go deeper into each of three components of the CPU microarchitecture. Let\u2019s start with the frontend.\n\n### SMT Implementation in the Frontend\n\nThe following figure shows a more zoomed in view of the microarchitecture frontend. It consists of several components with each having a distinct role behind the fetching and decoding of instructions. Let\u2019s talk about them one by one.\n\n[![A zoomed in view of the frontend of an X86 processor.

Source: Intel Technology Journal, Vol 06, Issue 01, 2002.\n\n### Instruction Pointers\n\nTo track which instructions to fetch, the frontend contains an instruction pointer which contains the address of the next instruction of the program.\n\nIn the case of an SMT capable processor, there are two sets of instruction pointers which track the next instruction for the two programs independently.\n\n#### Trace Cache\n\nThe instruction pointers gives the addresses of the next instructions of the threads and the frontend has to read the instructions from those addresses. Before doing that it first checks for the existence of those instructions in the trace cache.\n\nThe trace cache contains recently decoded traces of instructions. Instruction decoding is an expensive operation and some instructions need to be executed frequently. Having this cache helps the processor cut down the instruction execution latency.\n\nTrace cache is shared dynamically between the two logical processors on an as needed basis. If one thread is executing more instructions than the other, it is allowed to occupy more entries in the trace cache.\n\nEach entry in the cache is tagged with the thread information to distinguish the instructions of the two threads. The access to the trace cache is arbitrated between the two logical processors each cycle.\n\n#### The Instruction Translation Lookaside Buffer (ITLB) Cache\n\nIf there is a miss in the trace cache, then the frontend looks for the instruction for the given address in the L1 instruction cache. If there is a miss in the L1 instruction cache, then it needs to fetch the instruction from the next level cache or the main memory.\n\nThe L1 instruction caches data using its [virtual address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_address_space)\n, but main memory lookups require physical addresses. To translate the virtual addresses into physical addresses, the instruction lookaside buffer (ITLB) is used which contains the recently translated virtual addresses.\n\nIn an SMT capable processor, each logical processors has its own ITLB cache.\n\nThe instruction fetch logic for fetching the instructions from the main memory works on a first come first served basis, but it reserves at least one request slot for each logical processor so that both can make progress.\n\nOnce the instructions arrive from the main memory, they are kept in a small streaming buffer before they get picked up for decoding. These buffers are also small structures and duplicated for the logical processors in an SMT capable processor.\n\n#### The Uop Queue\n\nOnce the instructions are fetched, they are decoded into smaller and simpler instructions called micro instructions (uops). These uops are put into the uop queue which acts as the boundary between the CPU frontend and backend.\n\nThe uop queue is shared equally between the two logical processors. This static partitioning enables both the logical processors to make independent progress.\n\n### SMT Implementation in the Microarchitecture Backend\n\nOnce the Uop queue has microinstructions ready, the role of the backend starts. The following figure shows a zoomed in view of the backend of an Intel X86 processor.\n\n[![The zoomed in view of the backend of an Intel X86 processor.

Source: Intel Technology Journal, Vol 06, Issue 01, 2002.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about what happens in the backend component wise.\n\n#### Resource Allocator for Out-of-Order Execution\n\nThe backend picks up the micro instructions from the uop queue and executes them. However, it executes them out of their original program order.\n\nNearby instructions in a program are typically dependent on each other and these instructions may stall because they may perform a long latency operation, such as reading from main memory. As a result, all of their dependent instructions will also have to wait. In such a situation, the processor\u2019s resources are wasted. To alleviate this problem, out-of-order execution engine is employed which picks up later instructions of the program and executes them out of their original order.\n\nThe out-of-order execution engine consists of an allocator which identifies the resources required by these micro instructions and allocates them based on their availability.\n\nThe allocator allocates resources for the micro instructions of one logical processor in one cycle and then switches to the other logical processor in the next cycle. If the uop queue has micro instructions for only one of the logical processors, or one of the logical processors has exhausted its share of resources, then the allocator uses all the cycles for the other logical processor.\n\n#### Shared Execution Resources\n\nSo what are these resources that the allocator allocates to the micro instructions and how are they shared?\n\nThe first resource that the micro instructions need is registers. At the ISA level the processor might only have a very few registers (e.g. X86-64 has 16 general purpose integer registers), but at the microarchitecture level there are hundreds of physical integer registers, and similar number of floating-point registers. In an SMT enabled processor, these registers are divided equally between the two logical processors.\n\nApart from the registers, the backend also has a number of load and store buffers. These buffers are used for doing memory read and write operations. Again, in an SMT enabled processor, they are divided equally between the logical processors.\n\n#### Register Renaming\n\nTo enable out-of-order execution, the backend also needs to perform register renaming. Because at the ISA level there are only a handful of architectural registers, the program instructions will reuse the same register in many independent instructions. And, the out-of-order execution engine wants to execute these instructions ahead of their original order and in parallel. For doing so, it renames the original logical registers used in the program instructions to one of the physical registers. This mapping is maintained in the register alias table (RAT).\n\nBecause the two logical processors have their own sets of architectural registers, they also have their own copy of the RAT.\n\n#### Instruction Ready Queues\n\nAfter the register renaming and allocator stages, the instructions are almost ready to execute. They are put into two sets of queues \u2014 one is for the memory read/write instructions and the other is for all other general instructions. These queues are also partitioned equally between the two logical processors in an SMT enabled core.\n\n#### Instruction Schedulers\n\nThe processor has multiple instruction schedulers which operate in parallel. In each CPU cycle, some of the instructions from the instruction ready queues are pushed to the schedulers. The queues switch between the instructions of the two logical processors each cycle, i.e., in one cycle they push the instruction of one logical processor and in the next they switch to the second logical processor.\n\nEach scheduler itself has a small internal buffer to store these pushed instructions temporarily until the scheduler can schedule them for execution. Each of these instructions need certain operands and execution units to be available. As soon as the required data and resources for one of the instructions become available, the scheduler dispatches that instruction for execution.\n\nThe schedulers do not care about the logical processors, they will execute a micro instruction as soon as the resources required by that instruction are available. But to ensure fairness, there is a limit on the number of active entries for a logical processor in the scheduler\u2019s queue.\n\n#### Reorder Buffer\n\nAfter the execution of an instruction finishes and its result is ready, it is placed in the reorder buffer. Even though the instructions are executed out-of-order, they need to be committed to the processor\u2019s architecture state in their original program order. The reorder buffer enables this.\n\nThe reorder buffer is split equally between the two logical processors in an SMT enabled core.\n\n### Retirement Unit\n\nThe retirement unit tracks when the instructions are ready to be committed to the architecture state of the processor and retires them in their correct program order.\n\nIn an SMT enabled processor core, the retirement unit alternates between the micro instructions for each logical processor. If one of the logical processors does not have any micro instructions to be retired, then the retirement unit spends all the bandwidth on the other logical processor.\n\nAfter an instruction retires, it might also have to write to the L1 cache. At this point the selection logic comes into the picture to do these writes, and that also alternates between the two logical processors each cycle to write the data to the cache.\n\n* * *\n\nMemory Subsystem\n\n\n------------------\n\nWhile we have covered how the execution resources of a processor core are shared between the logical processors for an SMT enabled system, we have not talked about memory access. Let\u2019s discuss what happens there.\n\n### The Translation Lookaside Buffer\n\nThe translation lookaside buffer (TLB) is a small cache which holds the translation of virtual addresses to physical addresses for data requests. The TLB is shared dynamically between the two logical processors on an as needed basis. To distinguish the entries for the two logical processors, each entry is also tagged with the logical processor id.\n\n### The L1, L2 and L3 Caches\n\nEach CPU core has its own private L1 cache. Depending on the microarchitecture, the L2 cache might also be private or it might be shared between the cores. If there is an L3 cache, it is shared between the cores. The caches are also oblivious to the existence of the logical processors.\n\n[![Depiction of L1 and L2 caches in a 2 core processor. Each core has its own private L1 and L2 caches.](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6010b920-377a-41bf-9a47-d5378699661d_866x470.png \"Depiction of L1 and L2 caches in a 2 core processor.

Each core has its own private L1 and L2 caches.\n\nAs the L1 (and possibly L2) cache is private to the core, it will contain data for both the logical processors on an as needed basis. This can cause conflict and eviction of the data and hamper the performance. On the other hand if the threads running on the two logical processors are working with the same set of data, the shared cache might improve their performance.\n\n* * *\n\nPerformance Impact of SMT\n\n\n---------------------------\n\nAt this point we have covered almost everything about how SMT is implemented at the microarchitecture level and how the instructions for the two logical processors are executed in parallel. Now let\u2019s discuss the performance impact.\n\n### Running a Single Thread on an SMT Enabled Core\n\nAs we have seen, enabling SMT on a CPU core requires sharing many of the buffers and execution resources between the two logical processors. Even if there is only one thread running on an SMT enabled core, these resources remain unavailable to that thread which reduces its potential performance.\n\nApart from the wasted shared resources in the absence of the 2nd thread, there is another performance impact. The operating system runs an idle loop on the unused logical processor which waits for instructions to arrive. This loop also wastes resources which could otherwise be spent on letting the other logical processor at its peak potential.\n\n> On the Intel core processors there does not seem to be any sharing or partitioning of resources when only one thread is running on a core. They mention it as an improvement introduced in that generation of processors.

They mention that as an improvement in these generation of processors, there is no cost when only one thread is running on an SMT enabled core.\n\n### Running Two Threads on an SMT Enabled Core\n\nIf you have two threads running on the two logical processors, then one of the things to think about is their cache access patterns. If the threads are using the cache aggressively and competing for it then they are bound to run into conflicts and evict each other\u2019s data, which will degrade their performance.\n\nOn the other hand, if the threads are cooperating in nature, they might help improve each other\u2019s performance. For instance, one thread is producing some data which is consumed by the other thread, then their performance will improve because of the data sharing in the cache.\n\nIf the two threads are not competing for cache, then they might be able to run fine without hampering each other\u2019s performance, while improving the resource usage of the CPU core.\n\nHowever, many experts believe that when absolute maximum performance is needed for a program, it is best to disable SMT so that the single thread will have all the resources available to it.\n\n### Security Vulnerabilities around SMT\n\nApart from performance, there are also security issues associated with SMT which were discovered in the recent few years (see [this](https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux/notice-smt/)\n and [this](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/rhel-smt)\n for examples). Because of the shared resources and speculative execution of instructions, a lot of these issues open up possibilities of leaks of sensitive data to the attacker. As a result, the general advice has been to disable SMT in the systems. There is also [rumor](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/intels-arrow-lake-cpus-will-allegedly-ditch-hyper-threading-leak)\n that because of these issues Intel might remove hyperthreading from their next generation of processors (Arrow Lake).\n\n* * *\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\n\n------------------\n\nLet's wrap things up. Understanding how Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) works is super helpful when you\u2019re deciding whether or not to use it in your production servers. SMT was designed to make better use of CPU resources and boost instruction throughput. While it does a good job of that by letting multiple threads run at the same time, there are definitely some trade-offs to keep in mind.\n\nInside the processor, SMT means duplicating certain parts and sharing or dividing up others between the threads. This can lead to mixed results depending on what kind of work your CPU is handling. Sure, SMT can improve resource usage and system throughput overall, but it can also cause competition for shared resources, which can slow down individual threads.\n\nSecurity is another big factor. Recent vulnerabilities have shown that sharing resources in SMT-enabled CPUs can be risky. Sensitive data could end up getting exposed, which is why some experts often recommend disabling SMT in security-critical systems.\n\nSo, should you use SMT? It really depends. If your workloads need the highest performance and lowest latency, turning SMT off might give you that edge. But if you\u2019re running general-purpose tasks that can benefit from more parallelism, keeping SMT on could be a win.\n\nBy getting a handle on these details, you\u2019ll be better equipped to decide what's best for your setup, ensuring you get the most efficient\u2014and secure\u2014performance out of your servers.\n\n* * *\n\nReferences\n\n\n------------\n\n*   [Intel Technology Journal, 2002, Vol 06, Issue 1](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/research/2002-vol06-iss-1-intel-technology-journal.pdf)\n    \n*   [Simultaneous Multithreading: Maximizing On-Chip Parallelism](https://www.princeton.edu/~rblee/ELE572Papers/SMT_Eggers.pdf)\n    \n*   [SYNPA: SMT Performance Analysis and Allocation of Threads to Cores in ARM Processors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.12786)\n    \n*   [Intel Technology Journal, Vol 14, Issue 3, 2010](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/research/2010-vol14-iss-3-intel-technology-journal.pdf)\n    \n    * * *\n    \n\n### _**Support Confessions of a Code Addict**_\n\nIf you find my work interesting and valuable, you can support me by opting for a paid subscription (it\u2019s $6 monthly/$60 annual).

SMT is most useful when your code doesn&#x27;t have enough instruction-level parallelism but is still mostly compute bound.\n    - **hinkley** (): But the way you make rendering embarrassingly parallel is the way you make web servers parallel; treat the system as a large number of discrete tasks with deadlines you work toward and avoid letting them interact with each other as much as possible.<p>You don\u2019t worry about how long it takes to render one frame of a digital movie, you worry about how many CPU hours it takes to render five minutes of the movie.\n  - **gonzo** (): Intel\u2019s hyperthreading is really a write pipe hack.<p>It\u2019s not so much cache misses as allowing the core to run something else while the write completes.<p>This is why some code scales poorly and other code achieves near linear speed ups.\n    - **gpderetta** (): Why would the core have to wait for the write to complete?<p>A core stalls on a write only if the store buffer is full. As hyper threads share the write buffer, SMT makes store stalls more likely, not less ( but still unlikely to be the bottleneck).\n  - **hinkley** (): At this point, especially with backside power, I wonder how much cache stalls on one processor result in less thermal throttling both on that processor and neighboring ones.<p>Maybe we should just be letting these procs take their little naps?\n    - **immibis** (): This leads, in the extreme, to the idea of a huge array of very simple cores, which I believe is something that has been tried but never really caught on.\n- **pavlov** (): Intel\u2019s next generation Arrow Lake CPUs are supposed to remove hyperthreading (i.e. SMT) completely.<p>The performance gains were always heavily application-dependent, so maybe it\u2019s better to simplify.<p>Here\u2019s a recent discussion of when and where it makes sense:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39097124\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39097124</a>\n  - **PaulKeeble** (): Most programs end up with some limitation on the number of threads they can reasonably used. When you have a lot less Cores than that SMT makes a lot of sense to better utilise the resources of the CPU. However once you get to the point where you have enough cores SMT no longer makes any sense. I am not convinced we are necessarily there yet but the P&#x2F;E cores Intel are using are an alternative towards a similar goal and makes a lot of sense on the desktop given how many workloads are single&#x2F;low threaded. I can see the value in not having to deal with SMT and E core distinctions in application optimisation.<p>AMD on the other hand intends to keep mostly homogenous cores for now and continue to use SMT. I doubt its going to be simple to work out which strategy in practice is the best, its going to vary widely by application.\n    - **variadix** (): It is my understanding that SMT should be beneficial regardless of core count, as SMT should enable two threads that can stall waiting for memory fetches to fully utilize a single ALU, i.e. SMT improves ALU utilization in memory bound applications with multiple threads by interleaving ALU usage when each thread is waiting on memory. Maybe larger caches are reducing the benefits of SMT, but it should be beneficial as long as there are many threads who are generally bound by memory latency.\n    - **hinkley** (): I\u2019d like to see the math for why it doesn\u2019t work out to have a model where n real cores share a set of logic units for rare instructions and a few common ones where say the average number of instructions per clock is 2.66 so four cores each have 2 apiece and then share 3 between them.<p>When this whole idea first came up that\u2019s how I thought it was going to work, but we\u2019ve had two virtual processors sharing all of their logic units in common instead.\n  - **YesBox** (): Im creating a game + engine and speaking from personal experience&#x2F;my use case, hyperthreading was less performant than (praying to the CPU thread allocation god) each thread utilizing its own core. I decided to max out the number of threads by using std::thread::hardware_concurrency() &#x2F; 2 - 1. (i.e. number of cores - 1 ).<p>I&#x27;m working with a std::vector\n  - **hinkley** (): On common industry benchmarks at least every second generation of Intel hyperthreading ended up being slower than turning it off. Even when it worked it was barely double digit percent improvements, and there were periods when it was worse for consecutive generation. Why do they keep trying?\n    - **p_l** (): Most benchmarks are fine-tuned code that provides pretty much the perfect case for running with SMT off, because the real-world use cases that benefit from SMT are absent in those benchmarks.\n    - **tedunangst** (): Because the benchmarks don&#x27;t measure what people do with computers.\n- **leloctai** (): Does anyone know how to search for this type of detailed technical articles?<p>I&#x27;ve searched for this exact topic. As expected with kind of end user facing techs, the search results are always end user oriented article that explain nothing.\n  - **stareatgoats** (): I find that LLMs with web access are a good fit for this kind of search, at least to point me in the right direction. The URLs provided are mostly hallucinations, however.\n  - **layer8** (): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com</a>, assuming that most articles of that sort end up getting submitted to or mentioned on HN.\n"}]}

Yet, when she came to the end of her two-year study, what she found was inconclusive \u2014 given the choice, both populations of fish preferred the same, cooler waters. Her postdoctoral supervisor urged her to set aside the findings and move on to other studies: \u201cIt\u2019s a failed experiment,\u201d she was told. \u201cYou must have done something wrong.\u201d\n\nThe words stung because publications are a crucial piece of academic currency, particularly for an early-career researcher, and she knew she\u2019d face an uphill struggle to find a home for her results. Moreover, she felt a sense of urgency to share the counter-intuitive findings, which undermine the assumption that aquatic life might evolve a preference for higher temperatures in response to global warming.\n\nPilakouta, who is based at the University of St Andrews, UK, was one of the lucky ones. After submitting her findings to seven journals over six years, her study was finally published[1](#ref-CR1)\n in January 2023. But her experience illustrates [academia\u2019s oft-bemoaned \u2018file-drawer problem\u2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01389-7)\n, in which findings with null or negative results \u2014 those that fail to find a relationship between variables or groups, or that go against the preconceived hypothesis \u2014 gather dust in favour of studies with positive or significant findings. A 2022 survey of scientists in France, for instance, found that 75% were willing to publish null results they had produced, but only 12.5% were able to do so[2](#ref-CR2)\n. Over time, this bias in publications distorts the scientific record, and a focus on significant results can encourage researchers to selectively report their data or exaggerate the statistical importance of their findings. It also wastes time and money, because researchers might duplicate studies that had already been conducted but not published. Some evidence suggests that the problem is getting worse, with fewer negative results seeing the light of day[3](#ref-CR3)\n over time.\n\n[![](https://www.nature.com/media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-024-02383-9/d41586-024-02383-9_27154836.jpg)\\\n\\\nIlluminating \u2018the ugly side of science\u2019: fresh incentives for reporting negative results](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01389-7)\n\nFunders, publishers and researchers are not sitting idle. Many journals now encourage teams to submit plans and protocols for experiments before conducting them, so that the journals can review the proposals and commit to publishing the results, whatever the outcome. Hundreds of journals now offer such \u2018registered reports\u2019, and the number of journals adopting this approach has doubled since 2018.\n\nA laser focus on positive results is not the only way to do science, says Brian Nosek, executive director of the Center for Open Science in Charlottesville, Virginia. Nosek and a constellation of researchers across the world have been pushing to rewrite how research is conducted, challenging the very definition of success. This includes a crackdown on the nefarious side of science \u2014 misconduct such as plagiarism \u2014 but also a call to curb some of the \u2018softer\u2019 transgressions such as selective reporting, with a view to [publishing more negative findings](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02876-z)\n. These changes have started to materialize across the publishing industry, as preprint servers proliferate and publishers adopt new manuscript formats, launch journals dedicated to null results and call for special issues.\n\n\u201cWe can surely do better,\u201d Nosek says.\n\n**Hidden results**\n------------------\n\nResearchers have noted the file-drawer problem for decades. But the bigger problems it was causing did not become clear until the early 2010s, when they set out to reproduce the findings of several foundational experiments in psychology and medical science, and found that they could not. Scientists began to study the extent of this \u2018replication crisis\u2019 and the problem of publication bias.\n\nTheir research laid bare just how often negative results were being buried. In an analysis of more than 300,000 scientific conference presentations, informal posters or talks that scientists often endeavour to turn into papers, fewer than 40% were published in peer-reviewed journals, and negative or null findings were far less likely to be published than positive results[4](#ref-CR4)\n.\n\nThe extent of publication bias varies by discipline and by country, but the problem seems to have worsened over time. An analysis of 4,600 papers from 1990 to 2007 found that publication bias had increased by 22% over that period[3](#ref-CR3)\n.\n\nThere could be real-world implications to such a skew in publications. Among 74 registered clinical trials evaluating antidepressants, for example, nearly one-third remained unpublished; these trials were much more likely to show negative than positive results[5](#ref-CR5)\n. Judging by the publications alone, 94% of the trials looked as if they returned positive results, whereas a drug-approval panel judged that 51% did.\n\nThis selective reporting creates an inflated perception of drug efficacies, one compounded by meta-analyses \u2014 surveys of the published literature \u2014 that contain mainly studies with positive results.\n\n[![](https://www.nature.com/media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-024-02383-9/d41586-024-02383-9_27374058.jpg)\\\n\\\nHow early-career researchers can learn to trust negative data: five simple steps](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02876-z)\n\nThe bias is present despite the fact that investigators conducting clinical trials in the United States are mandated by law to report their results, regardless of outcome; there can be billions of dollars at stake and trial participants who have given their time and expect the results to be published. These results illustrate \u201chow high a hill there is to climb\u201d, Nosek says.\n\nAdding to the likelihood of bias, studies with negative or null findings are often given stricter scrutiny than those with positive findings, especially if the positive findings \u201cconfirm something we think is true\u201d, says Steven Goodman, founder of the Stanford Program on Research Rigor and Reproducibility at the Stanford School of Medicine in California.\n\nJessica Payne, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, says that there\u2019s still a perception that scientists must have had some flaw in their research design if a study returns negative or null results.\n\nIndeed, according to a survey of 480 economists[6](#ref-CR6)\n, studies with null results are perceived to be less publishable, of lower quality and less important than studies with large and significant results, even when features such as sample size are held constant \u2014 a phenomenon known as the null result penalty. If anything, Goodman says, a study with a large effect size should be scrutinized much more than one with a null finding.\n\n**Cultural bias**\n-----------------\n\nThe replication crisis made one fact crystal clear: incentive structures in academia are not always in line with research integrity and reproducibility. That has a large role in why so few negative studies are published, says Anne Scheel, a metascientist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.\n\nAt the crux of both academic misconduct and publication bias is the same \u2018publish or perish\u2019 culture, perpetuated by academic institutions, research funders, scholarly journals and scientists themselves, that rewards researchers when they publish findings in prestigious venues, Scheel says.\n\nBut these academic gatekeepers have biases, say some critics, who argue that funders and top-tier journals often crave novelty and attention-grabbing findings. Journal editors worry that pages full of null results will attract fewer readers, says Simine Vazire, a psychologist at the University of Melbourne in Australia and editor of the journal _Psychological Science_.\n\nThis creates a tight feedback loop between researchers and journals. To attract journals with findings that seem new and noteworthy, some scientists might be tempted to change their hypothesis after seeing the results, or to release only a portion of the data, or to perform statistical tricks, Nosek says.\n\n**Positive solutions**\n----------------------\n\nTo encourage more researchers to report null results, journals and funders are trying several schemes. One of the most significant changes to come out of the replication crisis is the expansion of preregistration (see \u2018Registrations on the rise\u2019), in which researchers must state their hypothesis and the outcomes they intend to measure in a public database at the outset of their study (this is already the norm in clinical trials).\n\n ![REGISTRATIONS ON THE RISE. Chart shows the number of study plans uploaded by researchers is increasing each year.](https://www.nature.com/media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-024-02383-9/d41586-024-02383-9_27365096.png)\n\nSource: OSF.IO\n\nThe preregistration model nudges researchers to be faithful to the original intent of their study, but it doesn\u2019t address biases that might affect whether they submit their findings to a journal, nor the biases of journal editors and reviewers in deciding what to publish, Nosek says.\n\nInstead, he and his colleagues have been focusing on promoting and evaluating the registered report model \u2014 similar to a preregistered report, but with the initial plan published by a journal, along with a commitment to peer-review and publish the results.\n\nPreliminary data look promising: when Scheel and her colleagues compared the results of 71 registered reports with a random sample of 152 standard psychology manuscripts, they found that 44% of the registered reports had positive results, compared with 96% of the standard publications[7](#ref-CR7)\n (see \u2018Intent to publish\u2019). And Nosek and his colleagues found that reviewers scored psychology and neuroscience registered reports higher on metrics of research rigour and quality compared with papers published under the standard model[8](#ref-CR8)\n.\n\n ![INTENT TO PUBLISH. Chart shows registered reports are much more likely to yield negative results](https://www.nature.com/media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-024-02383-9/d41586-024-02383-9_27365092.png)\n\nSource: Ref. 7\n\nWhen the format launched in 2012, only a handful of journals published registered reports; now more than 300 offer the format, including _PLoS ONE_ and _Nature_, which is published by Springer Nature (_Nature_\u2019s news team is editorially independent from its journal team). Since starting to offer the format in February 2023, _Nature_ has yet to publish any registered reports, but its sibling journal [_Nature Human Behaviour_ has](https://www.nature.com/nathumbehav/research-articles?type=registered-report)\n.\n\nAlthough the format has gained in popularity, there are still some kinks to be ironed out, researchers say. Earlier this year, Christine Blume, a sleep researcher at the University of Basel in Switzerland, published her first registered report[9](#ref-CR9)\n on how light affects human circadian rhythms in _Nature Human Behaviour._ Although she liked receiving feedback on her study design before data collection \u2014 \u201cit made me feel that I had the best study design to answer the question I set out to address,\u201d she says \u2014 she found it frustrating that the feedback process can span months, even though researchers have a limited time in which to spend grant money.\n\nThese practical concerns are important to address, Nosek says. He admits that his own paper about the quality of registered reports[8](#ref-CR8)\n was not itself a registered report, because the grant money was expiring and the team didn\u2019t have time to go through a lengthy approval process and complete its analysis. \u201cWe cannot dismiss pragmatics, but what we can do is think about how we lower the barrier so that more of these circumstances can be dealt with,\u201d he says.\n\nJournals that offer registered reports are not spread equally across disciplines; most are in psychology and, more recently, neuroscience. Few physical-science journals offer the format \u2014 even though null results, such as the failure of the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva in Switzerland to find new subatomic particles since the Higgs boson, have been an important part of progress. Emily Sena, a translational-medicine researcher and metascientist at the University of Edinburgh, UK, says that few academics in preclinical fields have been keen to try the format, especially when there is already so much red tape before researchers can begin their experiments.\n\n[![](https://www.nature.com/media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-024-02383-9/d41586-024-02383-9_27374054.jpg)\\\n\\\nDisputed dark-matter claim to be tested by new lab in South Korea](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01347-3)\n\nThe format has been slow to catch on among researchers, says Vazire. \u201cWe\u2019re not receiving many registered-report submissions.\u201d\n\nSena and her colleagues have been spreading the word about registered reports and helping journal editors to feel equipped to review submissions, she says. Some funders are providing cash incentives: in 2022, the [Center for Open Science](https://www.cos.io/blog/funding-consciousness-research)\n offered up to US$50,000 to consciousness researchers willing to publish a registered report for their work.\n\nIt will be important to track how these interventions affect marginalized groups in academia, Sena says. Academics of colour are more likely to be on a fixed contract, so they have less wiggle room to embrace formats that might be better for science overall but less helpful for individual scientists, she says.\n\nThe Center for Open Science is planning to run trials in which researchers are randomly assigned to use either the standard publication model or a registered report, to evaluate the rigour, acceptance rate and timelines of the resulting publications. Results are expected by 2027.\n\nNot every effort to reduce publication bias has borne fruit. One that has seldom worked, Nosek says, is to set up journals with the express purpose of publishing null results. These efforts are well intentioned, he says, but often do not work because a journal can become identified with studies that weren\u2019t able to be published elsewhere. \u201cIt can\u2019t provide the reward that researchers need,\u201d he says.\n\nPayne was a co-editor at one of these journals, _Experimental Results_, published by Cambridge University Press. After only three years, the journal ceased publication in 2023 despite carrying the \u201cimprimatur of Cambridge\u201d, she says.\n\nThere\u2019s an increasingly popular do-it-yourself route to publishing negative results: posting a manuscript on a preprint server. Publishing a preprint can offer an opportunity to showcase research without the pressure of journal submission. This option can be especially helpful for early-career researchers, Pilakouta says. Still, it takes time to write up a result, regardless of where it appears, and publishing on preprint servers is unlikely to offer researchers enough of an incentive to justify the time, Goodman says.\n\n**Null nuance**\n---------------\n\nAdvocates acknowledge that not every study that returns a null result is worthy of publishing. Goodman says he encourages researchers to publish null and negative findings that are \u201cinformative\u201d, meaning they come from studies and analyses that are designed rigorously, question previous results and open up fresh areas for exploration.\n\nFor example, there is a long-held idea that the womb is sterile \u2014 that the uterus and fetus are free of microorganisms. But, beginning in 2010, a series of papers found microbial contamination in the placenta, calling the hypothesis into question and suggesting that some complications of pregnancy could be linked to bacteria. It wasn\u2019t until 2019 that a study of placental samples from 537 women \u2014 by far the largest number in an analysis of this kind \u2014 rigorously showed the absence of any bacterial signal. That study set a benchmark for investigating the microbiome of tissues that carry few microorganisms and that can therefore give rise to false-positive results, and suggested that bacterial infection is not a common cause of problems in pregnancy[10](#ref-CR10)\n.\n\nBlume says it\u2019s important to extract something insightful from the data, even if they are inconclusive. For example, in 2022 she found that although artificial light suppresses the hormone melatonin, that didn\u2019t equate to a change in sleep quality[11](#ref-CR11)\n. The message that melatonin isn\u2019t necessarily a proxy for sleep quality might have helped that study to get published, she says.\n\nAs long as researchers continue to seek publication in prestigious outlets, publication bias won\u2019t go away, Goodman predicts. Still, he is surprised at how much progress has been made in the past decade: top-tier journals pledging to accept rigorous studies, regardless of outcome, would have been \u201cunheard of\u201d even five or ten years ago, he says.\n\nPilakouta now leads a laboratory and can set an example for her undergraduate and graduate students. But she\u2019s also seen first-hand how deeply engrained the thirst for positive findings is. \u201cIt concerns me how early it starts,\u201d she says. Next time she gets a null result, she says, she\u2019s hopeful that it won\u2019t take seven years to publish it.\n\n_Nature_ **631**, 728-730 (2024)\n\n_doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-02383-9_\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n1.

They are have extremely little incentive to change anything about the way scientific publishing works, as they are currently profiting the most from the existing structures, so them publishing something like this always leaves a bit of a sour taste.\n  - **MostlyStable** (): Providing _places_ to publish the result is only part of the problem. The other part is incentivizing scientists to do so. And similarly, Nature itself is responding to incentives. The core problem is that scientists themselves, the individuals, do not mostly display much interest (in a revealed preference kind of way) for null results. If scientists were interested and wanted to read articles about null results, then either journals like Nature would do so, or the numerous examples of journals like yours that have come and gone over the years would have been more succesful and widespread.<p>Because of this revealed lack of interest, high tier journals don&#x27;t tend to take of them (correctly responding to the lack of demand), and journals like your that specifically target these kinds of articles A) struggle to succeed and B) remain relatively &quot;low impact&quot;, which means that the professional rewards to publishing in them are not very high, which means that the return on effort of publishing such a work is lower.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the scientific community could do a lot more to combat this issue, but the core problem is that right now, the &quot;market&quot; is just following the incentives, and the incentives show that, despite what the stream of articles like this one over the past few decades is that most scientists don&#x27;t seem to <i>actually</i> have an interest in reading null-result papers.\n    - **dleeftink** (): What if to each publication of a non-null result, academics are given the opportunity to publish their nulls as well, if only as a appendix or better, a counterpublication to their main conclusions? I don&#x27;t buy the argument that papers need be of max-n length, now that documents and journals can be easily stored and distributed.<p>I would love something like Living Papers [0][1] to take off, where the null an non-non results could be compared interactively on similar footing.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;uwdata&#x2F;living-papers\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;uwdata&#x2F;living-papers</a><p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;idl.uw.edu&#x2F;living-papers-template&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;idl.uw.edu&#x2F;living-papers-template&#x2F;</a>\n    - **borski** (): From the article: \u201cA 2022 survey of scientists in France, for instance, found that 75% were willing to publish null results they had produced, but only 12.5% were able to do so.\u201d\n    - **c-linkage** (): In the old days, Science Weekly[1] used to print 4-5 paragraph summaries of published research in a three-column layout.  The magazine was dense with information across a huge number of topics.<p>And in the very old days, newspapers used to publish in tabular form local election results and sports games.<p>I feel that Nature could dedicate one to two pages of one paragraph summaries of null results with links to the published papers.<p>It&#x27;s amazingly easy to skim such pages to find interesting interesting things!<p>[1] I think that was the name; I canceled my subscription when they changed to a Scientific American wannabe.  I was looking for breadth not depth! I could always get the original paper if I wanted more information.\n  - **bumby** (): Years ago, I came across <i>SURE: Series of Unsurprising Results in Economics</i> with the goal of publishing good, but statistically insignificant, research.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.canterbury.ac.nz&#x2F;surejournal&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.canterbury.ac.nz&#x2F;surejournal&#x2F;</a>\n    - **jraph** (): I thought &quot;statistically insignificant&quot; meant we couldn&#x27;t conclude anything. So I was surprised.<p>[1] says:<p>&gt; In statistical hypothesis testing,[1][2] a result has statistical significance when a result at least as &quot;extreme&quot; would be very infrequent if the null hypothesis were true<p>So I understand this journal publishes results for which a hypothesis was tested, found to give insignificant results, which would rule out the hypothesis assuming the research was correctly conducted, without biases in the methodology, with a big enough sample, etc. Which would be worthy to know but no journal usually takes this research because it doesn&#x27;t make the headlines (which yes, I&#x27;ve always found was a shame).<p>Do I get this right?<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Statistical_significance\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Statistical_significance</a>\n  - **Waterluvian** (): Omg I love this. For like 20 years I\u2019ve joked about \u201cThe Journal of Null Results and Failed Experimenrs\u201d and it looks like you and your friends are actually doing it.<p>There\u2019s so much to learn from these cases.\n- **glial** (): The article hints at this, but not publishing null results (at least in a database - somewhere!) goes hand-in-hand with the replication crisis. An experimental outcome is always a single sample from a <i>distribution</i> of outcomes that you would obtain if you repeated the experiment many times.<p>Choosing to only publish the most extreme positive values means that when the experiment is replicated, &quot;regression to the mean&quot; makes it very likely that the measured effect will be weaker, and possibly not statistically significant. This is not an evidence of scientific fraud -- rather, it is a predictable outcome of a publishing incentive scheme that rewards hype and novelty over robust science.<p>I&#x27;ve said it before but it bears repeating - replicating published results, and adding the findings to a database, should be a standard part of PhD training programs.\n  - **matthewdgreen** (): There is a major issue of limited resources to replicate results, in terms of both time and funding. For example: I would assume that most important results are replicated. As a concrete example, if someone identifies a medication that (in one small trial) shows a statistically significant effect in curing some serious medical condition, then this will drive further replication attempts. On the other hand, if someone publishes a study showing that holding a pen in your mouth makes you 1% likelier to do well on the PSATs, this study will probably languish without replication for a decade \u2014 because honestly who cares? It\u2019s basically a curiosity. I can\u2019t help but notice that many of the headline results that characterize the \u201creplication crisis\u201d were small-effect-size social science experiments that fundamentally weren\u2019t that important outside of popular science news.<p>I\u2019m not saying that our current allocation of resources is optimal. I am pointing out that our resources are finite and \u201creplicate everything\u201d is not even a remotely practical allocation of those resources.\n    - **nostrademons** (): &gt; I would assume that most important results are replicated.<p>GP is pointing out that the incentive structure makes this an invalid assumption.  If publications reward hype and novelty when deciding what to publish, then there is no point spending your limited resources replicating other peoples&#x27; results, they won&#x27;t get published anyway.  And experiments that give a null result won&#x27;t be published anyway.  What&#x27;s left are one-off results that showed something surprising simply by chance and don&#x27;t replicate...but then, we generally will never know that they don&#x27;t replicate, because the replication experiment is not novel, has a low chance of being published, and hence isn&#x27;t worth spending limited resources on.<p>Basically the publication process introduces selection bias into the types of research that are even attempted, which then filters down into the conclusions we take from it.  A cornerstone of the scientific method is <i>random sampling</i>, but as long as the results that get disseminated are chosen by a non-random process, it introduces bias.\n    - **bumby** (): &gt;<i>\u201creplication crisis\u201d were small-effect-size social science experiments that fundamentally weren\u2019t that important outside of popular science news.</i><p>I don&#x27;t know that this is accurate. Some of these make their way to large-scale public policy, or give bona fides to people who craft far-reaching policy. This includes changes to 401k allocations to car-insurance rates and other mundane, but consequential policies.<p>The truth is most of science is not important outside of popular science news. So we shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that the bulk of replication crises are also in the same category. Claiming this means the replication crises is not really impactful may be a case of base rate neglect.<p>It&#x27;s also important to note that your example of medical replication is a relatively highly regulated area, where most other science is much less so.\n    - **freestyle24147** (): &gt; For example: I would assume that most important results are replicated.<p>The example you provide is solely your assumption? Seems pretty odd to provide a baseless assumption as an &quot;example&quot;.\n  - **aeternum** (): It&#x27;s kind of amazing that we discovered the scientific method, used it to invent the transistor and bring the information revolution.<p>Yet we still pool scientific results using only the printing press.<p>It&#x27;s like we unlocked the tech tree but then got so caught up in chasing citations and peer review that we forgot to use the new tech we invented.\n    - **glial** (): Yes, so-called &quot;social technology&quot; sometimes doesn&#x27;t feel very advanced.\n  - **setopt** (): Relevant XKCD: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;882&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;882&#x2F;</a><p>Do 20 experiments with a p&lt;5% criterion, and it\u2019s likely that one will be a false positive. Only publish positive results, and someone will eventually publish a false positive result without fraud.\n    - **etrautmann** (): Very few studies report a single statistical test as the sole conclusion. Most papers should assess some outcome in multiple ways using complementary data, multiple analyses etc. not always of course, but there are lots of ways of making sure your conclusions a robust without relying on a single analysis result.\n    - **some_random** (): It&#x27;s a great xkcd but it&#x27;s really wrong on one count, it&#x27;s not some outside media&#x2F;popular force compelling scientists to investigate something. Most of the time, researchers are looking to prove something they &quot;know&quot; to be true. They truly believe that jelly beans cause acne, they just need to prove it. When they get a negative result, they simply don&#x27;t believe it. Something must have gone wrong, obviously, because jelly beans obviously cause acne, so maybe it&#x27;s a color thing? Ah hah it&#x27;s the green ones, now that we have our results we can construct other metrics to support this correct data!<p>Eventually if we (the public) are lucky someone else in the field will disagree and run the trial again, which is how you get the alt text.\n    - **humansareok1** (): &gt;someone will eventually publish a false positive result without fraud.<p>I think most people correctly intuit that this is actually a type of very pernicious fraud.\n- **transcriptase** (): The irony of this appearing on the Nature site\u2026 when their own editors routinely reject even remarkable results that go on to become highly cited seminal papers in \u201clesser\u201d journals.\n"}]}

Here we have a (more or less) Raspberry Pi 5 form factor board with an x86 processor, the Intel N100. This means that I was able to grab the Windows 11 ISO and install it. I was able to go to Debian\u2019s homepage, grab the latest ISO and just, well, install it?\n\nI\u2019m going to try something slightly different though and rather than slam you with 20 graphs, I\u2019m going to approach it more as if you were asking me what I thought about it face-to-face. I\u2019ll include some data, but it\u2019s going to be my first thoughts upon opening and playing with the Radxa x4 first and foremost. It may get a little rambly but you all expect that from me at this point.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nRadxa x4 Specifications\n-----------------------\n\nAs a quick overview, the Radxa x4 offers the following:\n\n*   Intel N100 CPU (4 Alderlake CPU cores, up to 3.4GHz)\n*   Intel UHD Graphics (750MHz)\n*   4/8/12/16GB LPDDR5 4786MT/s\n*   2.5Gbit RJ45 Ethernet (with PoE support via HAT)\n*   M.2 M-Key connection for M.2 2230 NVMe drives\n*   12V USB-C Power Delivery Input\n*   3x USB-A 3.2 (10Gbps) ports, 1x USB-A 2.0\n*   WiFi 5 & BT5, or WiFi 6 & BT5.2 (the latter on 8GB RAM models and up)\n*   2x Micro HDMI (up to 4K60)\n*   Raspberry Pi RP2040 to control the 40-pin GPIO headers\n*   Fan & RTC Battery headers\n*   3.5mm Headphone & Microphone Jack\n*   eMMC is available either to solder yourself or when you order a SKU that includes it\n\nThe inclusion of the RP2040 for the GPIO header control is a great move. Long before I wrote the [ARM vs N100](https://bret.dk/intel-n100-a-challenge-to-arm/)\n piece (comparing an RK3588 to an Intel 100 Mini PC) during the Raspberry Pi shortages everyone was screaming \u201cJust buy a mini PC!!!\u201d but that really didn\u2019t help anyone who wanted or needed to interface with the Raspberry Pi\u2019s GPIO for their projects. Now, you have the best of both worlds but will Radxa nurture the product and ecosystem in a way that will pose a legitimate thread to those on the fence about the Raspberry Pi 5?\n\nOut of the Box\n--------------\n\nI received my package with the Radxa x4, its PoE+ HAT (there\u2019s a new, specific HAT for the x4), and the case/cooler hybrid they\u2019ve got going on and there was a fun mix of packaging. I definitely prefer when vendors ship in plastic cases (sorry, I know) as they\u2019re much more suited to stacking in my storage shelves.\n\nEverything was as I expected inside. The case/cooler came with a thermal pad (more on that later) and 2 feet sticker things so you don\u2019t have to have metal directly on a surface, the PoE HAT has standoffs pre-applied with extras in a bag, and the x4 board came with a pre-installed RTC battery and 2 WiFi antennas.\n\n![Radxa x4, Cooler, and PoE+ HAT packaging](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20768%201024'%3E%3C/svg%3E \"Intel N100 Radxa X4 First Thoughts 19\")\n\nInitial Setup\n-------------\n\nFor this post I\u2019ve been using the official Pi 5 PSU (it offers 2.25A at 12V) and a WD\\_BLACK SN770M 2230 M.2 NVMe drive.\n\n### BIOS\n\nI was fully expecting a BIOS offering 2-3 pages with 5 options per page given my experience with mini PCs (also rocking N100 CPUs) but upon first boot and jumping into the BIOS I was very pleasantly surprised. The screenshot below shows the American Megatrends BIOS built in April 2024, so really quite new!\n\n![Radxa x4 - Main BIOS Page](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20960%20540'%3E%3C/svg%3E \"Intel N100 Radxa X4 First Thoughts 20\")\n\n![Radxa x4 - Advanced BIOS Page](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20960%20540'%3E%3C/svg%3E \"Intel N100 Radxa X4 First Thoughts 21\")\n\n![Radxa x4 - Boot BIOS Page](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20960%20540'%3E%3C/svg%3E \"Intel N100 Radxa X4 First Thoughts 22\")\n\nIf you dig a little deeper into the options, you\u2019ll find you have the ability to really tweak the settings for most aspects of the system. I\u2019ve included a preview of the CPU Power Management page, and the NVMe information/configuration page, but there are quite a few more!\n\n![Radxa x4 - Advanced CPU Power Management BIOS Page](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20960%20540'%3E%3C/svg%3E \"Intel N100 Radxa X4 First Thoughts 23\")\n\n![Radxa x4 - Advanced NVMe Storage Configuration BIOS Page](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20960%20540'%3E%3C/svg%3E \"Intel N100 Radxa X4 First Thoughts 24\")\n\n### Debian 12 (Bookworm)\n\nI gave Debian a try first to see how things went and it was fairly uneventful. You just need to grab the relevant ISO (I took the net install option) and go through the installation process. I opted for GNOME as my desktop environment to look around and it was responsive, with most things working as expected.\n\nThe 2.5GbE network connection (supplied by an Intel I226-V NIC) was detected during installation, however, WiFi/BT wasn\u2019t and that carried on once into the OS. WiFi drivers are always a bit picky though.\n\nA [4K 60fps \u201cHDR\u201d video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXb3EKWsInQ&pp=ygUINGsgdmlkZW8%3D)\n in the included Firefox ran extremely smoothly (in my opinion) with around 40 frames dropped during the 5min13s video. These were barely noticeable and the Radxa x4 happily chugged along. A quick try on Windows showed much the same in terms of minimal dropped frames.\n\nI didn\u2019t spend much more time in Debian as I wanted to see how Windows 11 would fare. Sorry, not sorry.\n\n### Windows 11\n\nYou\u2019ll need to create a Windows media installation via their tool on another computer (or create installation media however you like) to get up and running but it\u2019s quick and easy, and within a couple of minutes I had the Windows installation running nice and smoothly.\n\n![Radxa x4 - Windows Installation finds no network drivers](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20960%20540'%3E%3C/svg%3E \"Intel N100 Radxa X4 First Thoughts 25\")\n\nUh oh..\n\nThat is until we reached the network detection part where it was immediately apparent that there were no suitable network drivers within the default Windows installation media. Bit of a bummer, but if you hit SHIFT+F10 you\u2019ll bring up a prompt that you can enter `OOBE\\BYPASSNRO` in and hit enter. Once done, the installer will restart and when you get back to the network page it will offer you the option to skip without an internet connection.\n\nOnce you\u2019re finally in Windows though, you\u2019ll want to address the network driver issue. Luckily, [Intel\u2019s driver page](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/15084/intel-ethernet-adapter-complete-driver-pack.html)\n has everything you need and you can download those on another device and copy them across with a USB drive or similar. When installed, you have yourself a little x4 ready to take on the world.\n\nQuick Tests\n-----------\n\n### Geekbench 6 for Windows\n\nI\u2019m not going to go through a full benchmarking suite here, but as I had Windows open, I thought I\u2019d see how Geekbench 6 was looking. On the CPU side, we ended up with a 1007 single-core and a 2295 multi-core score. For the Intel GPU, we saw 3246 for OpenCL and 3710 on Vulkan.\n\nA note for this section though, by default (and after changing the power plan) the maximum CPU frequency, even on single-core workloads was 2.9GHz. I likely need to dig into the BIOS a little more and make some changes to get the N100 running at its full speed. As a quick side note, changing the PL2 values to 6W from 25W made no difference for this benchmark and when run on Ubuntu, it got up to 3.1GHz and posted 1171 on single-core, and 2389 multi-core.\n\n### Networking\n\niperf3 between the Radxa x4 (on Windows) and my ROCK 5B (Debian) manages to saturate the 2.5Gbps connection in both directions so everything\u2019s looking good there. WiFi didn\u2019t install via Windows Update, nor was I able to quickly find a suitable driver so for this first thoughts post, WiFi gets a thumbs down, I\u2019ll have to look into that later.\n\nOn Ubuntu though the WiFi chip shows up as a Realtek RTL8852BE adapter and worked during the Ubuntu installation process.\n\n![Radxa x4 - iperf3 2.5GbE Results](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20904%20367'%3E%3C/svg%3E \"Intel N100 Radxa X4 First Thoughts 26\")\n\n### Power Draw\n\nUnder Windows 11 at idle with the default BIOS power settings (so the default power targets and Intel Speedstep enabled etc) I\u2019m pulling **8 watts** from the wall. This is with a basic keyboard, a Razer Deathadder (which does have an LED), 1x HDMI, 2.5GbE networking, and the WD\\_BLACK SN770M 500GB NVMe SSD.\n\nIf I yank out everything bar the power cable, idle power utilisation drops to around **6.8 watts**, so you can save 1.2 watts if you want to run it headless I suppose?\n\nIf I then stress the Intel N100 and its GPU with OCCT and the Power Configuration tester (it stresses the CPU, RAM and GPU all at once) it quickly jumps to **27.3 watts** and then drops down, likely because that\u2019s at the limit of what the 12V/2.25A PSU (the official Raspberry Pi 5 PSU) can offer so for future testing, I\u2019ll need to give it a slightly beefier power supply and see what it does. Stressing just the CPU and RAM results in **22.1 watts** of power draw.\n\n### Temperatures\n\nTo cover the question I saw a few times on Twitter when it was announced, no, I\u2019m going to recommend that you don\u2019t leave the CPU open to the world and run it raw. The whole thing gets extremely hot, extremely quickly and the only way you\u2019re going to be able to keep it somewhat under control is if you heavily throttle its power targets, in which case, what\u2019s the point? You could probably make do with an ARM chip if that\u2019s the plan.\n\nFortunately, I have the Radxa 4x Cooler/Case combo. It\u2019s not strictly a case as it has open sides and an open bottom but it keeps it off the surface where you\u2019ve placed it and it has a fan which is nice.\n\nUnfortunately, the thermal pad was crumbling and ripping when I tried to apply it and I have no idea if that\u2019s supposed to be normal or not? I was told that the thermal pad was rated for 13.8 watts, though I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite enough for this setup. Perhaps things would be better when I figure out how to get the fan to operate from behind the RP2040.\n\n![Radxa x4 - Cooler's Thermal Pad](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20767'%3E%3C/svg%3E \"Intel N100 Radxa X4 First Thoughts 27\")\n\nI\u2019ll revisit this topic in the follow-up piece but at first glance, I can actually see light between the board/thermal pad/cooler in places so that pad feels like it\u2019s either slightly too thin or something\u2019s happened to the pad that I have here and that hampers cooling.\n\n### Power over Ethernet\n\nOne of the selling points of this SBC was that the 2.5GbE port was PoE-compatible with a HAT, to the point where Radxa made a modified version of their PoE+ HAT to work specifically with the x4. After finding my go-to cable wouldn\u2019t do power and networking, I found one that worked and booted up fine. The second I hit it with a benchmark load it reset. Thinking the Power Limit 2 (PL2) may have been the problem with it set to 25W, I dropped it to 15W but nope, same problem.\n\n![Radxa x4 PoE+ HAT (Power over Ethernet)](https://bret.dk/intel-n100-radxa-x4-first-thoughts/Power%20over%20Ethernet)\n\nWas my 2.5Gbit PoE switch to blame? It was a no-name unit from AliExpress, so possibly? I switched (hehe) over to my UniFi PoE switch to see if that changed anything and what do you know, it was able to handle the spike just fine with the PL2 set to 15W. Would the cheap PoE switch handle it if it was set to 6W? It does, so that\u2019s good to know!\n\nSummary\n-------\n\nOverall, I still think it\u2019s a very good product but it has things that need to be looked at and that will likely be covered by documentation that (I hope) will be on the way soon.\n\nFor the most part everything is working as expected. You have the ease of using whichever ISO you can find (though you may have a couple of driver issues to work around depending on what OS you\u2019re looking to use. The cooler leaves a little to be desired, and when you have the PoE HAT installed too, your poor NVMe drive has around 1-2mm between it and the WiFi chip below, and then 3-4mm between it and the HAT above. When I get the fan on the HAT working this will alleviate a little of that pain.\n\n![Radxa x4 - WD_BLACK SN770M getting hot with no airflow](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20570%20119'%3E%3C/svg%3E \"Intel N100 Radxa X4 First Thoughts 29\")\n\nIt\u2019s getting hot in here\n\nI\u2019ll work a bit more on benchmarking during the week once a bit more information comes out and I\u2019ve tinkered a bit more but for now, it\u2019s almost there, and I look forward to seeing what I can do in the next week or so.\n\nFor the curious, too, an sbc-bench run on Ubuntu Server 24 (on kernel 6.8.0-39 with all BIOS settings default bar the 6W PL2) can be found at [https://0x0.st/Xf2I.bin](https://0x0.st/Xf2I.bin)\n\nIf you have any particular benchmark requests or things you want me to check out, let me know either in the comments or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bretweber)\n and I\u2019ll take a look!\n\n[SBC](https://bret.dk/tag/sbc/)\n[Single Board Computers](https://bret.dk/tag/single-board-computers/)\n\n0 comment 0[](# \"Like\") [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://bret.dk/intel-n100-radxa-x4-first-thoughts/)\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Check%20out%20this%20article:%20Intel%20N100%20Radxa%20X4%20First%20Thoughts%20-%20https://bret.dk/intel-n100-radxa-x4-first-thoughts/)\n[Reddit](https://reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbret.dk%2Fintel-n100-radxa-x4-first-thoughts%2F&title=Intel%20N100%20Radxa%20X4%20First%20Thoughts)\n[Email](mailto:?subject=Intel%20N100%20Radxa%20X4%20First%20Thoughts&BODY=https://bret.dk/intel-n100-radxa-x4-first-thoughts/)\n[](#)\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n##### [Bret](https://bret.dk/author/bret/ \"Author Bret\")\n\nBret has worked with Raspberry Pi computers for almost 10 years now and in that time he's benchmarked and tested over 30 Single Board computers.

The specifics of the origin have been documented by different people in various places.\n\nThere is an interesting thread which was discussed on the blog of the late Dan Weinreb, and preserved by archive.org. Ultimately, Guy Steele pulled up his records (in the form of printed emails). The below is an extract which is of historical interest and includes emails from the first couple months of Emacs in 1976. I quote some sections and include the verbatim text at the bottom, which starts with an ITS email from RMS to GLS.\n\nDan Weinreb introduces\n\n> And now, here\u2019s the mail from Guy Steele.

If Moon was involved, he must have\nhidden it from me. Do you know what\u2019s going on here?\n\nFirst some preliminary comments from me:\n\n- Secret decoder: GLS is Guy Steele, RMS is of course Richard\nStallman, DLW is Dan Weinreb (me), Moon is David Moon, Ed is Ed\nSchwalenberg who was beta-testing along with me, CBF is Charles\nFrankston, EAK is Earl Killian, ECC is Gene Cicarelli, RMF is Bob\nFrankston, and JLK is John Kulp.\n\n- I agree that I\u2019m somewhat vague on precisely which things Moon\ndid. I remember that there was a part of \u201c?\u201d called the \u201cloader\u201d that\nwas part of the underlying infrastructure, and I recall that Moon\ndeveloped this initially. Evidently Stallman improved upon it later\n(see first email below), as he surely improved upon everything as time\nwent by. Moon also worked on the \u201cMM macros\u201d, which meant \u201ccommands\nthat had descriptive English names instead of being one or two\nkeystrokes\u201d, corresponding to today\u2019s Meta-X commands. The MM macros\nfeature was brought into \u201c?\u201d from one of the Emacs predecessors,\nsometimes called TMACS, that was developed and used by Moon,\nCBF, EAK, and ECC. RMF had already figured out how to extract the MM commands\nfrom TMACS and insert them into TECMAC, one of the other Emacs\npredecessors, and I borrowed (copied) that code from him. It soon\nbecame clear that what we had here was a mess, and the right thing to\ndo was to all join forces and come up with a single code base that had\nthe best of all the ideas in it. Thus was the project born that\nturned into Emacs.\n\n- The reason the mail looks funny is that it predates the Internet;\nsome of what you see is Arpanet mail, and some (like the first one) is\ninternal ITS mail.\n\n- Guy sent PDF files of scans, which I have no way of posting here,\nbut he quotes all the important stuff below.\n\n- It would be even better had there been email from the previous\nweek, but, gee, you can\u2019t have everything.\n\nAnd now, here\u2019s the mail from Guy Steele. I think this is the\nbest information we are ever going to get, and that this is\nthe last word on the topic.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nI think all of us have been relying on our memories, which can\nfail in various ways. Last time around I checked my file folder\nof notes about Emacs, which has some useful information, but\nnot a lot about who did what. Now I have some more information\nto offer. I\u2019m going to quote email I received during the last\npart of 1976. The attached PDF files are scans I made today from\nmy paper archives of that email. I may have committed typographical\nerrors in quoting the email below; if in doubt, consult the scans.\n\nOn October 23, 1976, RMS sent this email to GLS:\n\nRMS@@MIT-AI 10/23/76 02:11:39\nTo: GLS at MIT-AI\nI HAVE HACKED ?MACS A LOT. IT NOW HAS\nAN IMPROVED LOADER MACRO AND SUITABLE PURIFY MACRO.\nTHE PURIFY MACRO HAS BEEN DEBUYGGED, AND WINS;\nI HAVEN\u2019T TESTED THE LOADER ON THE RESULT THOUGH.\n\nComments: (a) At this point the new proposed consolidated set of\nTECO macros for real-time editing was called \u201c?\u201d. I had chosen this\nname as a kind of stubborn joke, because a non-alphabetical character\nas the name of a program was just a little harder to invoke from DDT;\nalso, it followed the example of the @ program, which had just recently\ntaken over from the @ command in TECO for creating program listings\n\u2014another project that I started and then RMS markedly improved over\nthe years. However, the @ program was useless without command-line\narguments, so no one ever wanted to type @^K to start it, whereas\nit was desirable to start a frequently-used editor by typing a single-character\nname and then ^K, and I knew it, and I was being a bit mulish about it.\n\n(b) This email was sent just to GLS. From the fact that he was\nreporting progress to me, I infer from this that RMS did not yet regard\nhimself as the \u201cowner\u201d or \u201cprincipal hacker\u201d of this project. (While the\nAI Lab culture did support the notion that in principle anyone could hack\non any program, in practice it was also well-understood that certain\npeople had superior knowledge about certain programs, and that superior\nknowledge was consulted and paid due respect. I wouldn\u2019t have dreamed\nof hacking on TECO without consulting RMS, and he would not have hacked\non LISP without consulting JONL or me.)\n\nOn October 29, 1976, GLS sent this email to RMS:\n\nGLS@@MIT-AI 10/29/76 15:20:31\nTo: RMS at MIT-AI\nCC: GLS at MIT-AI\nSee .TECO.;?VARS > for a ? variables macro.\nIt has some hair for pushing and popping\nvariables as well as getting and setting them.\nSuggestions appreciated for reducing hair.\n\nComment: Six days later, I am still working on the implementation.\nI think that explodes the pretty myth that the project was handed over\nto RMS literally overnight.

In these I typically did not insert text in the middle of a line, I simply changed&#x2F;substituted text in the middle of the line. This helps maintain context in contrast to moving a point around.<p>Fortunately, my TECO exposure was mostly tempered through VTedit, a screen oriented macro set for TECO on the PDP.

Much more accessible.\n    - **brucehoult** (): &gt; VTedit<p>At Waikato university a student, Ivan Piacun, wrote &quot;vted&quot;, also a set of macros for TECO, on the PDP-11&#x2F;70. I would say it was what most people used until the switch to VAX.<p>I tracked Ivan down on LinkedIn a few months ago. He says when he wrote &quot;vted&quot; he had absolutely no knowledge of other similar efforts, or of either emacs or vi, both of which existed (on the other side of the world) a couple of years earlier.<p>Everyone worked in a silo in those days.<p>You might eventually see something in BYTE (though it focussed on microcomputers) or Dr Dobbs (ditto) or Wireless World. Or something might make it ono a DECUS tape. But mostly you were just completely isolated if you lived on an island in the South Pacific Ocean, as we did.<p>I was happy with EDT, never got to like TPU&#x27;s &quot;Eve&quot;, though I didn&#x27;t use it for long because I graduated ...<p>... graduated to a company that used DG MV10000 with AOS&#x2F;VS, which had an even worse clone of TECO called SPEED.<p>There must have been a better editor, though I think still a line editor, but I have absolutely no memory of what it was called or how it worked!!  I remember having to use SPEED for some things, but not most of the time. Maybe on very large files.<p>I was writing programs in PL&#x2F;I and also Postscript on that machine. I hooked the brand new Apple Laserwriter to the MV10000, something both DG and the Apple dealer said was impossible, and used it, at first, mostly to replace an HP pen plotter to make diagrams and graphs to physically paste into gaps left in hard copy &quot;camera ready&quot; output from an IBM DisplayWriter word processing system.\n    - **ggm** (): Yea, I walked into the SOS room day one of my degree and so learned SOS and Pascal instead of LISP and TECO. I do sometimes think I chose the wrong room. But your point about the point is well made, I think the DEC-10 TECO had a way to draw the current line and show where the point was, but it was very inferior to have to do it. Like chess wizards you&#x27;re meant to carry an image of the code in your head at all times. I tried teco, couldn&#x27;t entirely cope.<p>SOS led naturally to ed in due course. I did learn emacs, But never really took to it. Now, I run my daily work log in org mode and do nothing else in it, but it is very good as a massively over-engineered multi-window table editor.<p>Charles Forsyth (York) wrote a macro for ed which took the point, redrew the 24 line vt00 display to show the lines around it (12 above 11 below) and put you back where you were. He said it made ed as good as vi, and on the baudrate of the day who am I to disagree?\n"}]}

Your product is welcome and we can certainly use more competition in this space, but this aspect of it is basically enabling bad cultural practices and I wouldn\u2019t highlight it as a main selling point.\n  - **devjab** (): As someone who has worked in non-tech startup transitioning into enterprise, or enterprise organisarions for decades\u2026 I can tell you that non of these companies or organisations are capable of making meaningful interactions with operations. Disclaimer I haven\u2019t worked operations, but I\u2019ve been in relative close proximity with them work wise for natural reasons or using their infrastructure and sometimes making their tools or helping them with things like automation and Powershell.<p>Anyway in lot of places management see IT as a necessary evil. Like a service center similar to HR but less popular because management genuinely don\u2019t understand it and most IT departments lack HRs political shrewdness and communication abilities. At the same time it\u2019s not uncommon for users to be unable to tell support if they\u2019re on an Android or iOS device (yes, I\u2019m serious). Sometimes employees won\u2019t even differentiate between their professional and personal IT issues on their work devices. Which means that sometimes they\u2019ll raise hell over things that might not warrant full alert systems for on-site support.<p>What might be challenging here is that you\u2019ll still need someone to actually use the authors tool correctly. Though that is probably going to be a lot easier than making any sort of change management to was organisations relationship with IT.\n  - **stitched2gethr** (): If I may try to counter this point.<p>You are right, but there&#x27;s ideal state and there&#x27;s the real world. When on call most of my time is spent trying to make on call better. Reducing noise, providing more context when the alert and logs are lacking, and of course fixing the real issues that alerts have identified. That said there is a period of time in between receiving non-actionable alerts and classifying them as such, and more context without using brain power is always welcome. I think I&#x27;ll give it a shot.\n    - **aray07** (): Thanks for the feedback. Yeah, ideally, teams would go back and fix their misconfigured alerts. Unfortunately, on-call ends and people forget. The aim was to both provide context when an alert comes up as well as provide a report at the end so everybody has context into the state of alerts.\n  - **Too** (): 100x this. Garbage in = Garbage out.<p>In similar mindset, I&#x27;ve seen attempts to &quot;fix&quot; flaky test suites by retrying failing tests 5 times until they pass. What happens: You just set a new baseline of shit allowed. This allows even more noise to enter the system and you have to rerun them even more or need increasingly more advanced tools to filter out the noise.<p>Once the new baseline is anchored, you become dependent on the filter. Now every tool that interacts with the metrics need to be aware of the additional filter, there may be more than just the slack messages. Should your dashboard show the raw or the filtered metrics?<p>Devils advocate: consider an alert with 99&#x2F;100 false positives. The LLM may be good at classifying it as noisy but will it do a better job than a human to react to the 1 true positive? Maybe, but at the same time it allows more such noise to accumulate in the system, in effect a net negative. It&#x27;s better to remove such an alert instead. Even if the numbers were turned around in favor, that&#x27;s a lot of complexity added.<p>The additional context this product provides may of course still be useful and i applaud the effort. This product space does have a lot of potential for growth and is a real pain for operators. Be careful with using it as a substitute for proper alert hygiene and culture.\n- **aflag** (): It feels to me that using LLM to classify alerts as noisy is just adding risk instead of fixing the root cause of the problem. If an alert is known to be noisy and have appeared on slack before (which is how the LLM would figure out it&#x27;s a noisy alert), then just remove the alert? Otherwise, how will the LLM know it&#x27;s noise? Either it will correctly annoy you or hallucinate a reason it figures that alert is just noise.\n  - **jofer** (): There is a lot to be said for &quot;smoke test&quot; metrics. Things you expect to have frequent false positives, but are sometimes early indicators of larger problems or indicators of where to look deeper if something else goes sideways.  They&#x27;re not things that should wake you up in the middle of the night, but they&#x27;re a damn valuable tool to quickly figure out what&#x27;s actually wrong when a &quot;real&quot; alert triggers.<p>Many of these lend themselves well to dashboards instead of alerts, but not everything is &quot;dashboardable&quot;.  Sometimes it&#x27;s good to have a set of low-priority alerts that are treated differently than others.<p>E.g. &quot;we&#x27;re not receiving any data&#x2F;requests&quot;.  Sometimes that&#x27;s just a lull in activity. Maybe a holiday. Sometimes it&#x27;s because everything _else_ is broken and nothing is getting in (e.g. DNS issues).<p>With that said, I do think that classification should be made manually and not automatically.\n  - **aray07** (): yeah, thats the goal of adding the context and the report - to hopefully bring awareness to the team that this alert should be removed.<p>My rationale for flagging the alert was to help prioritization for the on-call (lets say there are multiple alerts going off at the same time)\n    - **ozim** (): That\u2019s a people problem and you cannot fix people problems with tech. If no one cares to do the good job of managing alerts putting AI in front of it will not change that.\n- **Jolter** (): Telecoms solved this problem fifteen years ago when they started automating Fault Management (google it).<p>Granted, neural networks were not generally applicable to this problem at the time, but this whole idea seems like the same problem being solved again.<p>Telecoms and IT used to supervise their networks using Alarms, in either a Network Management System (NMS) or something more ad-hoc like Nagios. There, you got structured alarms over a network, like SNMP traps, that got stored as records in a database. It\u2019s fairly easy to program filters using simple counting or more complex heuristics against a database.<p>Now, for some reason, alerting has shifted to Slack. Naturally since the data is now unstructured text, the solution involves an LLM! You build complexity into the filtering solution because you have an alarm infrastructure that\u2019s too simple.\n"}]}

Hopefully they still keep it. That was the best part of lemon squeezy\n  - **pc** (): We will definitely keep it.\n    - **thelittleone** (): Stripe has a history of shutting down legit businesses and blocking payouts of their rightfully earned income, whilst also profiting off those frozen funds by investing it.<p>Sad to see lemon squeezy acquired by stripe.\n    - **ssijak** (): Please remove random add-on costs from lemon squeezy. There are fees on top of fees that can accumulate to almost 10% which is outrageous.\n    - **rvnx** (): It&#x27;s in fact the reason people love LemonSqueezy (though it uses Stripe under), due to simplifying a lot the VAT remittance.\n  - **moneywoes** (): how did this feature work?\n    - **CallMeMarc** (): Stripe is a payment processor which basically means they process the payments for you, so you do have to figure out the tax part yourself (or use their tax product, but you&#x27;re still the one responsible for it.)<p>Lemon Squeezy is a merchant of record which means _they_ act as the merchant and sell the product to your customer. So they&#x27;ll collect VAT and make sure it lands in the pockets of the right country etc. and will pay you only the remainder (minus their cut).<p>Since Lemon Squeezy uses Stripe under the hood as their payment processor you had to basically pay a cut to two companies if you used Lemon Squeezy but in exchange you literally have to worry about nothing. You just get a nice B2B reverse invoice and don&#x27;t have to break your head around world wide (and especially EU) tax laws.<p>I really hope Stripe will double down on the whole MoR thing, it makes processing payments online so much nicer and less annoying.\n- **xyst** (): It\u2019s scary how big stripe is becoming. Instead of competing just buy up other companies. Might be another company that will require regulatory intervention and break them up (same as when the govt broke up the railroads)\n  - **input_sh** (): As someone from a country not supported by Stripe, it is annoying how frequently I find some tool that I might want to use, only to discover Stripe&#x27;s the only payout option.\n    - **wubrr** (): Out of curiosity - which country?\n  - **baq** (): &gt; Instead of competing just buy up other companies.<p>Zuck has shown the way.\n    - **ghufran_syed** (): And before them, Cisco\n- **l5870uoo9y** (): &gt; Nine months after our public launch in 2021, we surpassed $1M in ARR and never looked back.<p>Stripe is buying a lucrative business, but more importantly it is buying the complex knowhow of running an international tax-compliant merchant of record. They can then integrate this into their product. I switched to LemonSqueezy primarily out of concern for EU-wide tax ramifications (EU strikes again). Is there a reason to choose LemonSqueezy over Stripe if you are located in the US? There hasn&#x27;t been a single VAT-compliance case to my knowledge and the need for MoR is unclear.\n  - **HyprMusic** (): I&#x27;ve never understood the notion that US based companies have it easier. They still to pay applicable tax in every country&#x2F;state that their customers reside.<p>If anything, EU companies have it slightly easier because they can file all of their EU-based taxes using One Stop Shop.\n    - **xzel** (): You can do Non-Union OSS as a US company as well. I\u2019d say the most annoying thing about the EU is their minimum transaction to start filing is very low compared to US Nexus rules.\n  - **johneth** (): &gt; Is there a reason to choose LemonSqueezy over Stripe if you are located in the US? There hasn&#x27;t been a single VAT-compliance case to my knowledge and the need for MoR is unclear.<p>It&#x27;s not just the EU that charges VAT (or VAT-like taxes).<p>Most countries (and in the US&#x27;s case, subregions within) charge some form of sales tax that&#x27;s a pain to manage yourself if you&#x27;re not a huge operation.<p>Always good to comply with tax laws (if not for the obviously good moral&#x2F;ethical reasons, then definitely for legal reasons!)\n    - **drewda** (): In addition to the overall benefits of not having non-compete agreements, California&#x27;s software startup ecosystem also benefits from not having to deal with charging sales tax when selling SaaS[1][2]<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.taxjar.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;saas-california-sales-tax\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.taxjar.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;saas-california-sales-tax</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdtfa.ca.gov&#x2F;lawguides&#x2F;vol1&#x2F;sutr&#x2F;1502.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdtfa.ca.gov&#x2F;lawguides&#x2F;vol1&#x2F;sutr&#x2F;1502.html</a>\n    - **l5870uoo9y** (): US states have a minimum threshold of $100,000 and upwards so you can be compliant without having to worry about it until you start making larger revenue. Most startups never reach these generous thresholds in the first place.\n"}]}

The agent follows an airline passenger onto their plane (without objection by airline staff), snatches the passenger\u2019s carry-on bag, carries it off the plane, and refuses to return it. The agent claims the right to keep the passenger\u2019s bag as long as it takes to get a warrant (although they don\u2019t have that right, and don\u2019t actually get a warrant).\n\nThis is not meaningful \u201cconsent\u201d, and it\u2019s not a valid legal basis for a search.\n\nAn ongoing [class-action lawsuit](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/16702479/brown-v-transportation-security-adminstration/)\n by the [Institute for Justice](https://ij.org/case/dea-tsa-forfeitures/)\n on behalf\u00a0 of air travelers who have been searched without probable cause on the pretextual claim of \u201cconsent\u201d in order to find, seize, and \u201cforfeit\u201d their cash has shown just how common this pattern of illegal search and seizure is.\n\nWe reported on the [filing\u00a0 of this lawsuit](https://papersplease.org/wp/2020/01/17/is-the-tsa-screening-for-threats-to-aviation-or-for-cash-and-drugs/)\n in 2020, and on the [first substantive ruling](https://papersplease.org/wp/2021/04/05/can-tsa-checkpoints-be-used-as-a-general-law-enforcement-dragnet/)\n in the case, in favor of the plaintiffs and allowing the case to move forward, in 2021.\n\nSince then, the case has [bogged down](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/16702479/brown-v-transportation-security-adminstration/)\n in foot-dragging by the DEA and TSA, [resisting discovery](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.pawd.263087/gov.uscourts.pawd.263087.127.0.pdf)\n of their records of\u00a0 searches and seizures of cash from travelers at airports.\n\nThe DEA and TSA continue to claim \u2014 despite the [initial ruling against them](https://papersplease.org/wp/2021/04/05/can-tsa-checkpoints-be-used-as-a-general-law-enforcement-dragnet/)\n on this point \u2014\u00a0 that they don\u2019t have an actionable \u201cpolicy\u201d of targeting travelers with cash for searches because they haven\u2019t put this policy in writing. But the latest [status report](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.pawd.263087/gov.uscourts.pawd.263087.127.0.pdf)\n on discovery to date indicates that the DEA and TSA have made thousands of seizures of \u201cbulk currency\u201d from air travelers in recent years. This is clearly a routine and officially sanctioned agency practice, whether or not anyone has put it in writing.\n\nThe DEA and TSA claim that the volume of records of these searches and seizures would make producing them unduly burdensome. But the volume of these records is symptomatic of the scale and systemic nature of the problem \u2014 which is what the plaintiffs are trying to prove. The plaintiffs have suggested examining a statistical sample of the records of airport searches and seizures, but the DEA and TSA are resisting even that.\n\nWe wish the plaintiffs in this case and their lawyers success in their pursuit of justice for travelers.\n\n4 thoughts on \u201cWhat \u201cconsent\u201d really looks like for the DEA and TSA\u201d\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.

That removes the immediate incentive for abuse, while retaining the tool for what it was intended for: actual criminals.<p>(I don\u2019t have the sources but read years ago that states that let the cops keep the cash have ridiculous levels of abusive confiscations, whereas states that have the money go to the state coffers basically don\u2019t)<p>(Most civil asset forfeiture is done by local cops stopping people on the highway and similar)\n  - **greyface-** (): The DoJ has established a workaround for this, and it&#x27;s called Equitable Sharing.  Local cop seizes assets on behalf of the DEA or other federal agency, assets are held by the federal agency rather than the local agency, the federal agency sends a kickback payment to the local agency and takes over prosecution, local agency washes its hands of the matter, enjoys the plunder, and goes off and robs more subjects.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;criminal&#x2F;media&#x2F;1044326&#x2F;dl\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;criminal&#x2F;media&#x2F;1044326&#x2F;dl</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Equitable_sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Equitable_sharing</a>\n    - **umbra07** (): why on earth do they get a kickback??\n  - **bagels** (): How about no more asset forfeiture?<p>Why not require due process and 4th amendment rights to be respected?<p>If the government convicts you of the crime and proves the money is the proceeds of the crime you are convicted for, them maybe it makes sense for the government to seize the funds. Absent that, it should be taken for what it is: armed robery.\n    - **samus** (): The whole exigent circumstances exception is required to stop a crime which is highly probably to already be in progress and for which evidence could be lost to the prosecution. Especially at international airports this is highly likely to happen. The problem is that the system is set up in a way that encourages corruption.\n    - **trod123** (): Well something like that would be a real democracy, not the fakes that pass for it today.\n  - **gg82** (): Just stop trying to justify highway robbery.

Thankfully no one was seriously injured. A half dozen people were swept away and rescued from trees. The rest of us got to higher floors of the building and they were concerned about us waiting out the flood because cars from the parking lot floated and rammed the first floor of the building. It was featured on an episode of I Do, Redo.<p>They brought in busses to transport the 61 people rescued to the local high school where they had activated the Red Cross and provided us dry cloths and food. I can&#x27;t say enough nice things about the Red Cross volunteers and the staff at the high school, and same with the fire department and EMS.<p>However, when we were loaded into the busses, the police held the busses until they had a drug dog come into the busses to walk up and down the aisles, and only after that let the busses take us to the high school. While no one was seriously injured physically, people were traumatized from the flooding event and many attendees suffered from PTSD for years.<p>It was so cruel for the police department to do what they did with everyone in the mental state that we were in.<p>For reasons I do not understand, we were not free to leave the high school, and even the people that did not lose their cars to the flood were required to go to the high school on the busses. I can&#x27;t recall how long they detained us at the high school, I&#x27;d guess 3 to 5 hours, and then they let us leave. The friend that came to pick me up (I did lose my vehicle to the flood) got to the high school not long after I did and had to wait in the parking lot for hours.<p>We wanted to feel safe once we got to dry land after the ordeal we went through. I did not feel safe until I got home.\n  - **raxxorraxor** (): If this happened as you described it, worst part is that this evident lack of judgement would be detrimental in fighting real crime. If they were legally compelled to do it, there also is a political problem.<p>Maybe there is a silly explanation about the bus being confiscated from a local drug lord and people needed to be protected, but otherwise I don&#x27;t see a way how you officials could come out here not looking like idiots.\n  - **amanaplanacanal** (): What the hell? Why would they do such a thing?\n    - **chickenchase-rd** (): quite simply to screen drugs from reaching the emergency shelter, which is also a school, and save you from special prosecution applied to these situations and protect themselves politically from something the media will monitor closely. if they screened you at the shelter, its worse for everyone if they find anything on premises. emergency shelters will house anyone affected, including vulnerable elderly, children, mentally ill people, and unhoused heavy drug users. everyone was likely checked which also protects you while sheltering. i volunteered for a shelter during katrina and it gets out of hand very fast with just one delusional person or drug user. i stopped a robbery within 3 minutes of starting my first shift. a deranged person was aggressively drug seeking, and robbing pill bottles away from an elderly woman in a wheelchair. could have been your mom or grandma just caught up in it. so- check everyone as a protocol, as its for public shelter safety. seek therapy for ptsd, its never too late to heal. if you have heavy bias against law enforcement, perhaps consider joining a community program or volunteering - do it as a therapy to yourself to help improve your insight which will help everyone work towards improving the situation in your community.\n    - **archerx** (): To bust some one too justify their budgets. All paths lead to money, almost always.\n  - **2-3-7-43-1807** (): am i just a little stupid today or does this story have nothing to do with dea or tsa?\n    - **burnished** (): They announce it as an unrelated tangent, reread the first sentence\n- **joezydeco** (): If you want to see an example of what this looks like, the Institute has a video recorded by a passenger that knew his rights.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;0XBzV0bDZdQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;0XBzV0bDZdQ</a>\n  - **lifestyleguru** (): Unfortunately not consenting and knowing your rights doesn&#x27;t help because they will search your belongings anyway. You can only delay the search which usually will not work in your favour. It happens in many developed &quot;rule of law&quot; countries. Something similar happened to me in Germany when traveling alone by car. When they noticed I have multiple smartphones with me they went hysterical. Luckily I had no cash on me, neither drugs of course. They were pursuing some criminals and perfectly wasted half an hour on scrolling my smartphones. Not even a single nude photo, just sunsets and travel photos with my girlfriend. Great job Kriminalpolizei from Dresden.\n    - **bravura** (): German polizei search culture blows my mind though.<p>When festival buses are going to Fusion Festival (think Burning Man), it&#x27;s common knowledge that half the buses will be stopped and &quot;controlled&quot;, i.e. warantless search of all the passengers&#x27; belongings. That my German friends think this is normal or acceptable just blows my mind.\n    - **koonsolo** (): So did you consent on searching your phone or something else happened?\n  - **lloeki** (): This is about a U.S.A citizen on a domestic flight. I&#x27;m wondering, in similar situations what kind of rights - if any - do non-U.S.A citizen have on domestic flights? or international flights to&#x2F;from the U.S.A?\n    - **voxic11** (): The 4th Amendment doesn&#x27;t mention citizenship. It covers the entirety of the people of the United States. So U.S Citizens, U.S. Nationals, and permanent resident aliens all have the same rights as far as the 4th Amendment is concerned. It does get more ambiguous when you consider undocumented aliens, temporary resident aliens, and nonresident aliens.\n"}]}

They found that the probability of a favorable decision drops from about 65% to almost 0% from the first ruling to the last ruling within each session and that the rate of favorable rulings returns to 65% in a session following a food break. The authors argue that these findings provide support for extraneous factors influencing judicial decisions and cautiously speculate that the effect might be driven by mental depletion. A simulation shows that the observed influence of order can be alternatively explained by a statistical artifact resulting from favorable rulings taking longer than unfavorable ones. An effect of similar magnitude would be produced by a (hypothetical) rational judge who plans ahead minimally and ends a session instead of starting cases that he or she assumes will take longer directly before the break. One methodological detail further increased the magnitude of the artifact and generates it even without assuming any foresight concerning the upcoming case. Implications for this article are discussed and the increased application of simulations to identify nonobvious rational explanations is recommended.\n\n* * *\n\nKeywords\n--------\n\n[decision making](/core/search?filters[keywords]=decision making)\n[legal realism](/core/search?filters[keywords]=legal realism)\n[mental depletion](/core/search?filters[keywords]=mental depletion)\n[rationality](/core/search?filters[keywords]=rationality)\n[methods](/core/search?filters[keywords]=methods)\n\n* * *\n\nType\n\nResearch Article\n\nInformation\n\n[Judgment and Decision Making](/core/journals/judgment-and-decision-making)\n , [Volume 11](/core/journals/judgment-and-decision-making/volume/D668E1FC37E1CDBE5AF9E251E489CADB) , [Issue 6](/core/journals/judgment-and-decision-making/issue/CC038B04C1E5709159616BFDDDB396FB) , November 2016 , pp. 601 - 610\n\nDOI: [https://doi.org/10.1017/S1930297500004812 \\[Opens in a new window\\]](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1930297500004812)\n\nCreative Commons\n\n![Creative Common License - CC](https://www.cambridge.org/core/page-component/img/license-cc-icon.e3a74ed.svg)![Creative Common License - BY](https://www.cambridge.org/core/page-component/img/license-by-icon.33e212c.svg)\n\nThe authors license this article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright \u00a9 The Authors \\[2016\\] This is an Open Access article, distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), which permits unrestricted re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n\n1 Introduction\n--------------\n\nIn decisions in various contexts, individuals do not strictly adhere to standards of rationality, in that judgments and choices are influenced by many irrelevant factors such as changes in presentation format (e.g., [Reference Kahneman and TverskyKahneman & Tversky, 1984](#rf17)\n), the presence of random anchors (e.g., [Reference Tversky and KahnemanTversky & Kahneman, 1974](#rf27)\n), and many more. It is, however, of course socially desirable for the outcomes of legal cases to depend solely on laws and relevant facts and for influences of extraneous factors to be minimal. Decisions should, for instance, not be influenced by the order in which cases are presented or by whether the judge is exhausted or hungry.\n\nStill, it has been demonstrated that judges show the same fallacies and biases as other individuals do (e.g., [Reference Englich, Mussweiler and StrackEnglich, Mussweiler & Strack, 2006](#rf6)\n; [Reference Guthrie, Rachlinski and WistrichGuthrie, Rachlinski & Wistrich, 2000](#rf10)\n, 2007). In psychology, the prevailing descriptive models consequently take into account that legal decision making does not follow a purely rational calculation, but involves some constructive and intuitive element, making it potentially malleable to irrelevant factors (e.g., [Reference Pennington and HastiePennington & Hastie, 1992](#rf21)\n; [Reference SimonSimon, 2004](#rf25)\n; [Reference ThagardThagard, 2006](#rf26)\n).\n\nSimilarly, in the legal literature the traditional view that legal judgments can be mechanically or logically derived from official legal materials \u2014 such as statutes and reported court cases \u2014 in the vast majority of instances has been challenged by legal realism (e.g., Frank, 1930) maintaining that \u201clegal doctrine \\[\u2026\\] is more malleable, less determinate, and less causal of judicial outcomes than the traditional view of law\u2019s constraints supposes\u201d ([Reference SchauerSchauer, 2013](#rf24)\n). Legal realism holds that \u2014 aside from official legal materials \u2014 extraneous factors influence legal rulings such as ideology or policy preferences of the judge, general judgment biases, and \u2014 similar to current approaches in psychology \u2014 it has been argued that rulings are partially guided by intuition (Hutcheson, 1929; see Schauer, 2013, for a review). Legal realism has a long history and many facets but it is often caricaturized by the phrase that \u201cjustice is what the judge ate for breakfast\u201d, which also has become a trope for legal realism in general.\n\nIn summary, there is clear evidence that judicial decision making is influenced to some degree by extraneous factors, which is also reflected in prevailing theories in law and psychology. Danziger, Levav and Avnaim-Pesso (2011a) (hereafter DLA) aim to add to this body of evidence by demonstrating that deciding multiple cases in a row influences legal outcomes of later cases. DLA analyzed 1,112 legal rulings of Israeli parole boards that cover about 40% of the parole requests of the country. They assessed the effect of the serial order in which cases are presented within a ruling session and took advantage of the fact that the ruling boards work on the cases in three sessions per day, separated by a late morning snack and a lunch break.\n\nDLA found that the probability of a favorable decision drops from about 65% in the first ruling to almost 0% in the last ruling within each session ([Figure 1](#fig1)\n). The rate of favorable rulings returns to 65% in the session following the break. DLA argue that this effect of ordering shows that judges are influenced by extraneous factors and they speculate that the effect is caused by mental depletion ([Reference Muraven and BaumeisterMuraven & Baumeister, 2000](#rf19)\n). The argument is that, after repeated decisions, judges become exhausted, hungry or mentally depleted and use the simple and less effortful strategy to stick with the status quo by rejecting the request resulting in what could be called an \u201cirrational hungry judge effect\u201d.\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAMLCwgAAACH5BAAAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)\n\nFigure 1: Results redrawn from the graph provided in Danziger et al. (2011a).\n\nConsidering the tremendous consequences for human beings, the large magnitude of the effect, and the fact that the investigated boards decide almost half of the parole requests in Israel, these results are unexpected and potentially alarming. Consequently the article has attracted attention and the supposed order effect is considerably cited in psychology (e.g., [Reference Evans, Dillon, Goldin and KruegerEvans, Dillon, Goldin & Krueger, 2011](#rf7)\n), law (e.g., Schauer, 2013), economics (e.g., Kamenica, 2012), and beyond (e.g., Gibb, 2012; [Reference Yamada, Camerer, Fujie, Kato, Matsuda, Takano and TakahashiYamada et al., 2012](#rf29)\n).[Footnote 1](#fn1)\n The fact that \u2014 in line with the trope for legal realism mentioned above \u2014 eating (or not) is considered important for legal rulings according to DLA might have additionally contributed to the tendency to cite it heavily.\n\n2 Critical Evaluation\n---------------------\n\nOne further factor that most likely contributed to the popularity of the article is the large magnitude of the effect. A drop of favorable decisions from 65% in the first trial to 5% in the last trial as observed in DLA is equivalent to an odds ratio of 35 or a standardized mean difference of _d_ = 1.96 ([Reference ChinnChinn, 2000](#rf3)\n). This is more than twice the size of the conventional limit for large effects. The meta-analytic estimate for effect of mental depletion, which is considered as potential explanation for the drop, is _d_ = \u20130.10 to 0.25 (publication-bias corrected), meaning that on average only small effects of mental depletion can be expected ([Reference Carter and McCulloughCarter & McCullough, 2013](#rf1)\n).[Footnote 2](#fn2)\n Similarly, a recent multi-lab registered replication study involving 23 labs (N= 2,142) found an effect of d = 0.04 and not significantly different from zero ([Reference Hagger and ChatzisarantisHagger & Chatzisarantis, 2016](#rf12)\n). Hence, under the assumption that mental depletion is causing the findings, the magnitude of the effect observed by DLA is surprisingly large. It might, however, be argued that manipulations of depletion and exhaustion might be stronger in reality than in the lab causing stronger effects.\n\nConsidering the latter issue and taking into account that the potential costs for giving wrong advice are high, it seems justified to take a closer look at the results and the analyses on which they are based.\n\n### 2.1 Non-random Order of Cases\n\nOne crucial assumption permitting conclusions concerning the effect of case ordering is that case ordering is random or at least not driven by hidden factors that are not taken into account in the analysis. If more severe cases went first, for example, and severe cases at the same time reduced the likelihood of favorable decisions, spurious correlations could result. In their regression analyses, DLA take this concern into account by including reasonable control variables for substantive factors that might influence both ordering and rulings. They show that the results remain robust when controlling statistically for severity of offence, previous imprisonment, months served, participation in a rehabilitation program, and proportion of previous favorable decisions.\n\nStill in a direct reply to DLA, it has been argued that case order is influenced by systematic factors that DLA did not account for ([Reference Weinshall-Margel and ShapardWeinshall-Margel & Shapard, 2011](#rf28)\n). Specifically, Weinshall-Margel and Shapard (2011) conducted informal interviews with persons involved in the parole decision process (including a panel judge) and came to the conclusion that case ordering is not random. They argue, among other things, that the downward trend might be due to the fact that, within each session, unrepresented prisoners usually go last and are less likely to be granted parole than prisoners who are represented by attorneys. In a response, Danziger, Levav and Avnaim-Pesso (2011b) show that the downward trend also holds when controlling for representation by an attorney although they do not report whether the magnitude of the effect remains the same, which seems unlikely given the correlation pattern reported above. Note also the more general methodological problem that statistical control need not remove the full effect of a variable measured in rough categories (e.g., severity of offence) or with error.\n\n### 2.2 Decision to Take a Break\n\nA second, potentially more subtle, concern is that results might be driven by factors that systematically influence judges\u2019 decisions to take a break. DLA analyze whether properties of a case influence the likelihood of taking a break afterwards. They report that the substantive case properties mentioned above do not predict when a break is taken. Furthermore, they argue that judges do not know details of the upcoming case such as whether the prisoner has a previous incarceration record or not. Interestingly, Weinshall-Margel and Shapard still report their interviewees to state that judges might aim to finish a set of cases (e.g., to complete all cases from one prison) within a session. This indicates that some organizational planning occurs. At first glance, however, it seems hard to understand how this mere organizational planning of when to end a session without taking into account any details of the case could contribute to the downward trend. I will discuss this issue in detail in the next section.\n\nIn summary, in their reply DLA (2011b) argue that they could rule out all alternative explanations and therefore uphold their conclusion that parole decisions are influenced by legally irrelevant factors in that repeated choice is causing a decreasing likelihood for making favorable decision as the session progresses.\n\n3 Rational Time Management and Selective Dropouts\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nIf we accept that the effect of ordinal position also holds after all reasonable substantive factors that might have influenced ordering and decisions to take a break are ruled out, we must still ask whether more subtle factors could explain the observed effects, without assuming that judgments are influenced to a large degree by irrelevant factors. One major concern is the effects of selective dropouts and rational time management when to end a session in order to complete cases or sets of cases within it. Selective dropout in this context refers to the possibility that \u2014 for whatever reason \u2014 cases with favorable rulings have a lower likelihood to be in the sample of cases with higher ordinal number in a session than cases with unfavorable rulings.\n\nDLA report that favorable rulings take longer (_M_ = 7.37 min, _SD_ = 5.11) than unfavorable rulings (_M_ = 5.21 min, _SD_ = 4.97). The number of cases completed in each session varies between 2 and 28[Footnote 3](#fn3)\n and DLA present rulings for 10 to 13 cases within each session, with the last ruling having a probability of zero (or in one case close to zero) to be favorable, respectively. Consequently, the number of observations within each session decreases with ordinal position and the last observations in a session are likely to consist of a few observations only. Considering that favorable rulings take longer than unfavorable rulings, the dropout is not random. On average, sessions that consist of mainly unfavorable decisions will allow judges to make many rulings. Therefore, in the reduced sample of observations constituting the data for higher ordinal positions, the relative frequency of rulings from sessions with mainly unfavorable decisions increases.[Footnote 4](#fn4)\n\nJudges have to finish cases before they take a break. To avoid starving, they are likely to avoid starting potentially complex cases (or sets of cases) directly before the break. It seems reasonable to assume that simple surface features that are available before investigating the case in detail (e.g., amount of material, kind of the request, representation by an attorney, some specifics of the attorney, the prison, or the prisoner) allow judges roughly to estimate the time the next case will take above chance level. Importantly, such surface features could also be unrelated to the content features that could produce non-random ordering of cases and that DLA already control for in their analysis.\n\nStill, as mentioned above, it is hard to see whether and to what degree not starting overly long cases before a break would lead to the observation of downward sloping effects without assuming that judgments are influenced by extraneous factors at all. I conducted simulations to make the effect visible.\n\n4 Simulating Choice Patterns by a (hypothetical) Rational Judge\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI simulated the rulings of an ideal judge who makes choices without errors and biases. I assume that she has a rough time limit for each session and works on cases until recognizing that a case would go over this limit. The case that would be too long would not be solved any more in the current session, but it would be the first case in the next session.[Footnote 5](#fn5)\n\nThe results indicate that, following the approach by DLA, a rational judge working on cases that are presented in random order would show a strongly decreasing probability of a favorable decision towards the end of the session. Even the shape of the curve and the magnitude of the effect are comparable to that observed by DLA. Simulations assuming normally distributed decision times ([Figure 2](#fig2)\n, right) or more realistic positively-skewed decision times that follow a Weibull distribution ([Figure 2](#fig2)\n, left) lead to similar conclusions, and repeated simulations show that the qualitative pattern of results is robust to changes in distributional assumptions. As one could expect, however, estimations become unstable for higher decision numbers due to the low number of remaining observations (see [Figure 2](#fig2)\n, size of circles), resulting in occasional peaks to high or zero percentages. Not surprisingly, statistical analysis reveals that the downward trend is significant and that first decisions are more favorable than later ones, as it was found by DLA.\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAMLCwgAAACH5BAAAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)\n\nFigure 2: Simulated favorability ratings of a perfectly rational judge who works on cases with the speed observed by DLA and starts a new session for each case that would go over the time limit. The left chart depicts a distribution assuming that decision times follow a Weibull distribution, while the right chart shows results assuming a normal distribution. Circle diameter indicates the sample size for each observation and shows the large degree of dropouts within sessions.\n\n[Figure 3](#fig3)\n shows why this effect appears for the normally distributed case. Distributions of decision time have different means with favorable cases taking longer than unfavorable ones (left panel). Consequently, the relative frequency of favorable cases (in all cases) that would still fit in the session decreases with remaining time. In our example, if 15 minutes remain in the session, essentially all cases would still be started since such long times are rare both for favorable and unfavorable cases ([Figure 3](#fig3)\n, left). The ratio of favorable and unfavorable cases therefore roughly reflects the overall ratio in the population. For 5 minutes remaining, however, only 12% of the favorable cases could still be included in the session, whereas the respective proportion for unfavorable cases is much higher at 46%. Hence, the relative frequency of favorable cases, as compared to all cases, decreases with the time that remains causing selective dropout.\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAMLCwgAAACH5BAAAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)\n\nFigure 3: Distribution of decision times (left) and effect of the remaining time on the proportion of favorable cases in the remaining selective sample (right).\n\nThe cumulative probability distribution for favorable decisions (taking into account differences in base rates for both events) is plotted in the right panel of [Figure 3](#fig3)\n. For long remaining times, the proportion of favorable cases is close to the base rate of 36%. For short remaining times, the proportion approaches values close to zero. With an increasing decision number within a session, the remaining time decreases, causing the downward sloping effect. Since sessions can stop after 1 to 14 decisions, the stopping effect is not only found after case 14, but already to a smaller degree for earlier cases. Hence, the probability can be expected to drop from 36% to zero percent for later rulings.\n\nIt remains to be explained why the proportion of favorable rulings (in both the simulation and the DLA data) peaks beyond 36% in the first round. This \u201cbeginning effect\u201d is indirectly caused by the above mechanism as well, since the session is more likely to end before a favorable ruling than before an unfavorable ruling. The probability mass that is missing in the last decision of the previous session adds to the probability mass of favorable cases in the first decision of the next session (either on the same day or the first session of the next day). If one assumes that planning is not only done for single cases, but also occasionally concerns sets of cases ([Reference Weinshall-Margel and ShapardWeinshall-Margel & Shapard, 2011](#rf28)\n), this would explain why the probability of a favorable decision in the second and third ruling in a session is also above the base rate of 36%.[Footnote 6](#fn6)\n Furthermore, the observation by DLA that the overall length of sessions varies considerably does not speak against the planning explanation since the effect also holds under the assumption that judges have implicit time limits that vary from session to session. Also, it should be noted that the planning described here is merely organizational and does not require any foresight concerning how the case will be decided. All it requires is that the judges have a rough estimate, whether the next case will be quick or take longer.\n\n5 Further Factors: Autocorrelation and Censoring\n------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter demonstrating that rational time management and selective dropout can cause dramatic drops in favorability ratings, the robustness of this finding and the influence of further factors should be investigated. Two factors are considered. First, DLA report that they censor their data, in that the last 5% of the cases in each session are dropped, with the intention of eliminating small samples at higher ordinal positions. Second, as mentioned above (Footnote 4) results from DLA indicate that there is an autocorrelation in the time-series, in that rulings correlate with previous ones. Since the consequences of these factors are again hard to anticipate, I conducted further analyses to explore their effects.\n\nTo investigate the effect of censoring, I dropped the last 5% of the rulings within each session in the normal distribution data-set from above ([Figure 2](#fig2)\n, right) and analyzed the data again. Results remained largely the same, but censoring increased the magnitude of the drop ([Figure 4](#fig4)\n, left), which was also observed for the Weibull data set and was consistently replicated in further simulations. Hence, censoring artificially increases selective dropout, and therefore it should not be used when analyzing the effect of ordinal position on favorability rulings.\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAMLCwgAAACH5BAAAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)\n\nFigure 4: Simulated favorability ratings including the effects of censoring the last 5% of cases within each session (left) and additional autocorrelation (right). Circle diameter represents _n_.\n\nTo investigate the effect of autocorrelation, I generated new data sets (_N_ = 50,000) based on normally distributed response times with the same parameters as above in which, however, rulings correlated with rulings directly before at a low degrees. [Figure 4](#fig4)\n (right) shows results from a data set with a (first-order) autocorrelation of _r_ = .10 and including censoring as above. Results are generally comparable to the results from the independent data-set, and autocorrelation did not noticeably change the magnitude of the artifact.\n\n6 Rational Time Management without Foresight\n--------------------------------------------\n\nOne assumption underlying the simulations reported so far is that judges plan ahead and do not start a case that would be too long to finish within the time limit for a session. This planning would require some degree of foresight in that judges (or other people administratively involved) generate estimates of the time required for finishing the upcoming case. Thereby estimates do not need to be exact to generate the artifact and can be based on rough surface cues as mentioned above as well. Also cues for time management might be (consciously or unconsciously) conveyed by administrative persons involved in the process of handling cases ([Reference PfungstPfungst, 1911](#rf22)\n). As mentioned above, DLA state that details about the upcoming case are not known to the members of the board in advance. Since, however, DLA did not have full control over the situations, the existence of such cues cannot be entirely ruled out.\n\nStill, presuming foresight in many cases is admittedly a relatively strong assumption. I therefore tested whether the analysis conducted by DLA would also generate similar artifacts without foresight in that judges stop _after_ a case went over the available time limit.[Footnote 7](#fn7)\n When conducting this analysis without censoring and autocorrelation, all artifacts disappear, as one would expect. Interestingly, however, when including censoring and autocorrelation a downward sloping effect appears again ([Figure 5](#fig5)\n). The reason for this is that cases with favorable rulings are more likely to hit the time limit than cases with unfavorable ruling due to the mere fact that they are longer. Dropping 5% of the cases at the end means often postponing this last case, which is more likely favorable than unfavorable. Hence, censoring causes selective dropout of favorable cases even without foresight and artificially induces a downward sloping effect of favorable ruling. The effect was, however, smaller than in the simulations with foresight and caused a drop of roughly 15% only.\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAMLCwgAAACH5BAAAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)\n\nFigure 5: Simulated favorability ratings without foresight concerning the upcoming case but including the effects of censoring the last 5% of cases within each session and autocorrelation _r_ = .10 (_N_ = 50,000). Circle diameter represents _n_.\n\n7 Discussion\n------------\n\nIn a comprehensive analysis of legal rulings of Israeli parole boards DLA identified that the proportion of favorable rulings decreases with serial order within a session but goes back to the initial level after a session break that includes eating a meal. This finding is important as well as potentially alarming, since both serial order and food supply are clearly extraneous factors that should not affect whether a parole request is decided favorable or not. DLA argue that their findings indicate that extraneous variables influence judicial decisions and cautiously interpret their finding with reference to a mental depletion account.\n\nI critically revisited this interpretation and tested whether the core of the conclusion \u2014 namely that order and mental depletion causally influence the outcome of legal judgments \u2014 can be made on the basis of the presented data. Specifically, I tested whether the observed downward trend could also results from selective dropout of favorable cases due to rational time management, censoring of data and autocorrelation. The analysis shows that large parts \u2014 but admittedly not all aspects, see below \u2014 of the findings could be accounted for by this explanation.\n\nThe simulations show that the seemingly dramatic drop of favorable rulings from 65% to almost 0% towards the end of each session does not conclusively indicate bias or error in judicial decision making. A drop of comparable \u2014 although somewhat smaller \u2014 magnitude would be produced by a (hypothetical) rational judge who aims to avoid starting work on cases that could not be completed in the time that remains in the current session. Furthermore, the simulations revealed that the practice of censoring data within a session is problematic and artificially induces a downward sloping effect even without foresight and under the less restrictive assumption that judges stop each session after a time limit has been passed. Hence, the analyses by DLA do not provide conclusive evidence for the hypothesis that extraneous factors influence legal rulings.\n\n### 7.1 Caveats\n\nIt has to be acknowledged that the analyses reported in this paper do not preclude that serial order and mental depletion might have affected the legal judgments analyzed by DLA. The analysis, however, demonstrates that there is a possible alternative explanation for large parts of the results within a rational framework that does not require the assumption of any influence of extraneous factors. The strong downward-sloping effect could \u2014 at least in parts \u2014 simply reflect a statistical artifacts.\n\nStill, rational time management and selective dropout cannot account for all aspects of the data by DLA. First, the magnitude of the effects reported in the simulations was somewhat smaller than the magnitude of the original effects.[Footnote 8](#fn8)\n This was mainly due to the fact that, second, in the original data the percentage of favorable rulings started at a higher level than in the current simulations (i.e. 65% instead of 45%). Particularly, the high starting rates at the beginning of the day (and not only after the breaks) are hard to explain by my account since postponing cases to a different day and panel seems not overly likely.[Footnote 9](#fn9)\n Third, since the statistical effects described here are driven by ordinal position, they cannot easily explain the effects of time on favorable rulings reported in DLA as well. Fourth, the shape of the curves differ in some details in that the empirical curve tended to be smoother whereas the simulated data showed stronger drops at the beginning and the end a flatter area in between. Finally, given that according to DLA the setting might have precluded direct foresight concerning the upcoming case to some degree, the remaining effects of rational time management could be estimated to account for a drop of 15% to 45% only.\n\nIn sum, rational time management and selective dropout \u2014 although potentially being important \u2014 can explain the findings by DLA only in parts. Hence, further factors may exist that contributed to the observed downward-sloping effect. The remaining differences could potentially be explained by other methodological factors such as the issue of non-random ordering in that prisoners represented by attorneys went first ([Reference Weinshall-Margel and ShapardWeinshall-Margel & Shapard, 2011](#rf28)\n). Alternatively, extraneous factors such as causal effects of serial case ordering and mental depletion might have played a role. Since the data are not available[Footnote 10](#fn10)\n for further detailed analyses and the exact circumstances under which the rulings were made cannot be fully reconstructed, these issues have to be addressed in further studies.\n\nThe analyses reported here indicates that the effect of serial order and mental depletion is overestimated in the original work by DLA. Rational time management concerning when to take a break and effects of non-random ordering of cases with represented prisoners going first identified by Weinshall-Margel and Shapard (2011) are lumped together with potential effects of serial order and mental depletion so that the latter are overestimated. Disentangling these influences should lead to more reasonable (smaller) estimates concerning the magnitude of the effect. According to previous findings on mental depletion, the \u201cirrational hungry judge effect\u201d should at best be small in magnitude (if existing at all; see [Reference Carter and McCulloughCarter & McCullough, 2013](#rf1)\n), which might render the observed extraneous influence less relevant from a practical point of view and the need for state interventions less urgent.\n\nMore generally, the analysis shows that sometimes there is a nonobvious rational basis for irrational-looking behavior. Computer simulations as well as formal mathematical analyses are measures to identify them. Such analyses have revealed, for example, that whole strands of literature supposedly demonstrating irrational behavior such as spreading apart effects after choice ([Reference Chen and RisenChen & Risen, 2010](#rf2)\n), unrealistic optimism ([Reference Harris and HahnHarris & Hahn, 2011](#rf14)\n) or the adaptive usage of simple heuristics (Jekel & Gl\u00f6ckner, in press) are methodological or statistical artifacts that would be shown by completely rational agents as well. I argue that simulations of rational agents and formal mathematical analyses should be used earlier and more intensely in the research process to investigate findings of supposedly hugely irrational behavior before jumping to the conclusion that legal actors \u2014 or any other individuals \u2014 are irrational.\n\nAppendix: STATA code for the simulation program for normal distributed response times\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAMLCwgAAACH5BAAAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)\n\n* * *\n\nFootnotes\n---------\n\nAcknowledgment: I thank Mark Schweizer, Marc Jekel, Susann Fiedler, and Christoph Engel for helpful comments on earlier versions of this manuscript and Brian Cooper for proof reading.\n\n1 Citation count: 222 as of February 27, 2015, source: Google scholar.\n\n2 Applying a different (and less robust) correction method lead to somewhat higher estimates in the range of medium size effects ([Reference Hagger, Wood, Stiff and ChatzisarantisHagger, Wood, Stiff & Chatzisarantis, 2010](#rf13)\n).\n\n3 DLA (2011a, p. 6889): \u201cThe breaks were taken after an average of 7.8 cases (SD = 4.51, min = 2, max = 28) in the morning session and 11.4 cases (SD = 5.14, min = 2, max = 25) in the postsnack/prelunch session.\u201d\n\n4 As DLA show, rulings are positively autocorrelated in that the proportion of previously positive ratings predicts later positive ratings. In combination with the selective dropout effect, this autocorrelation could potentially accentuate a downward sloping effect.\n\n5 Specifically, I first generated 10,000 randomly ordered cases, taking into account the base rate of cases that should be decided positively (36%) or negatively (64%). Second, I generated distributions of response times for these rulings, taking into account the different time averages for favorable and unfavorable cases and adding (a) normally distributed noise or (b) noise from a Weibull distribution that is positively-skewed and therefore better represents the typical response time distributions (e.g., [Reference Rouder, Lu, Speckman, Sun and JiangRouder, Lu, Speckman, Sun & Jiang, 2005](#rf23)\n). I used normally distributed noise with _M_ = 0 and _SD_ = 2 (the lower _SD_ was used to avoid having many negative response times) and a Weibull distribution with a shape parameter _k_ = 1.5, a scaling parameter _l_ = 1 that were transformed to roughly represent the observed means by multiplying them with a scaling factor _m_ (unfavorable: _m_ = 5.8; favorable: _m_ = 8.2). The decision time limit was 60 minutes. Further simulations show that the qualitative results are robust to changes in these specifications, as long as mean differences are represented. The Appendix shows an example of the STATA code for the simulation with normal distributed response times.\n\n6 Note, once again, that the planning I refer to here and in the remaining article does not involve any assumption that the order of cases is changed. It concerns only the decision to end a session now or after one (or a few) further cases.\n\n7 I am grateful to an anonymous reviewer for pointing out this possibility and suggesting a statistical implementation for it.\n\n8 Recent investigations, however, demonstrate that initial publications reveal larger effects than later replications of the same effect. On average initially published effect sizes are twice as large as effects in replications ([Reference OpenOpen Science Collaboration, 2015](#rf20)\n).\n\n9 One explanation for this high starting effect at the beginning of the day might be that \u2013 given the flexibility in the timing of the breaks \u2014 the rate of attorneys being present is particularly large for the first case of the day to minimize waiting time.\n\n10 Although the authors were willing to share the data, they were prevented from doing so by those who initially gave them access.\n\n* * *\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nCarter, E.

Less severe cases were seen first, which meant the more severe cases (ie those with more severe penalties) were shown later.<p><i>\u201cDanziger etal. rely crucially on the assumption that the order of the cases is random and, thus, exogenous to the decision-making process. This assumption has been forcefully challenged. For a short and very critical reply in PNAS, Keren Weinshall-Margel and John Shapard analyzed the data of the original study\u2014as well as other self-collected data\u2014and conducted additional interviews with the court personnel involved.Footnote  51 They point out that the order of the cases is not random: The panel tries to deal with all cases from one prison before a break, before then moving to the cases of the next prison after a break. Most importantly, though, requests from prisoners who are not represented by a lawyer are typically dealt with at the end of each session. So, prisoners without legal representation are less likely to receive a favorable decision compared to those with legal representation.Footnote  52 Additionally, lawyers often represent several inmates and decide on the order in which the cases are presented\u2014it might well be possible that they start with the strongest cases\u201d</i><p>[1] Chatziathanasiou, K., 2022.

Less severe cases were seen first, which meant the more severe cases (ie those with more severe penalties) were shown later.<p>Isn&#x27;t that order creating a bias for the judge? Should the cases be randomized instead?\n    - **bumby** (): Yes, in the words of the linked paper it injects exogenous decision making. In other words, the decision is based on more than just the judge so we can\u2019t conclude the discrepancy is due to the judge\u2019s personal bias.\n    - **sandworm101** (): &gt;&gt; Should the cases be randomized instead?<p>Like any other set of tasks, the order is a practical matter.  Severe cases are more random, sometimes sucking up more time than expected.  Put them early in the order and any delay will impact everyone. So judges try to get the easy&#x2F;predictable stuff done first, minimizing the number of people impacted by the inevitable delays. (Doctors do the same if they can, trying tk see easy patients first.)<p>Also, as with any other process, you want to start with a few easy wins in order to solve inevitable problems. If there is something wrong with the court tech (recorders, security etc) you can work it out during the easy cases.  Save the murders for after everything is sorted.<p>Thirdly, prisoners are different than normal people. They do not control thier own scheduals. Put thier case early in the docket and they might miss breakfast at the jail. Prisoners are also moved as groups. Put them randomly on the docket and they all have to wait all day.  Put them as a group towards the end and the group wont wait as long. So cases involving prisoners, on average the more severe cases, are placed later on the docket.\n    - **cortesoft** (): Maybe? I don\u2019t think the severity of a case is unknown to the judge, though, even with random ordering.\n- **tylervigen** (): This is fascinating.<p>For those unfamiliar, the original study found that judges were kinder in their decisions right after lunch, and harshest right before. (I\u2019m dramatically oversimplifying, but that\u2019s the bit folks usually cite.)<p>This study contests the strength of that finding by showing that positive rulings take longer, and that you can fit more simple negative rulings in just before a break (negative rulings are denials of parole, if you\u2019re wondering why they are faster). Judges don\u2019t want to start complex cases that are more likely to be favorable just before break. (Again, dramatically simplifying. The article has more.)<p>I have cited the original study countless times, and this injects a lot more nuance for me. I\u2019m glad it was revisited.\n  - **wodenokoto** (): There was another article related to this study that hit the HN front page. It talked about the size of effect, and argued that the effect size was ridiculously big, and if true, we should see giant spikes in car crashes around lunch, big enough for common sense to ban driving just before noon.<p>I think you&#x27;ll enjoy the read.<p>&gt; If hunger had an effect on our mental resources of this magnitude, our society would fall into minor chaos every day at 11:45.

It had one million _global_ checkboxes on it - checking a box checked it for everyone on the site, immediately.\n\nThe site, 30 minutes after launch\n\nI built the site in 2 days. I thought I\u2019d get a few hundred users, max. That is _not_ what happened.\n\nInstead, within hours of launching, tens of thousands of users checked millions of boxes. They piled in from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40975509)\n, [/r/InternetIsBeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/1dp4t7y/onemillioncheckboxescom_a_webpage_with_one/)\n, [Mastodon](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@eieio/112683641983412025)\n and [Twitter](https://x.com/itseieio/status/1805986839058079896)\n. A few days later OMCB appeared in the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/02/one-million-checkboxes-pointless-fun/)\n and the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/style/one-million-checkboxes-game.html)\n.\n\nHere\u2019s what activity looked like on the first day (I launched at 11:30 AM EST).\n\n![boxes checked hourly during OMCB's first day. The first few hours are missing.](https://eieio.games/assets/images/scaling-omcb/first-day-hourly-unique-visitors.png) ![boxes checked hourly during OMCB's first day. The first few hours are missing.](https://eieio.games/assets/images/scaling-omcb/first-day-hourly-checked-boxes.png)\n\nI don't have logs for checked boxes from the first few hours because I originally only kept the latest 1 million logs for a given day(!)\n\nI wasn\u2019t prepared for this level of activity. The site crashed a lot. But by day 2 I started to stabilize things and people checked over 50 million boxes. We passed 650 million before I sunset the site 2 weeks later.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about how I kept the site (mostly) online!\n\nThe original architecture\n-------------------------\n\nHere\u2019s the gist of the original architecture:\n\n![The original architecture of OMCB. The client maintains a bitset tracking which boxes are checked and renders checkboxes lazily. The server has 1 million bits of state - one for each checkbox. The server flips bit 3 when box 3 is checked or unchecked.](https://eieio.games/assets/images/scaling-omcb/simple-original-arch.png)\n\nOur checkbox state is just one million bits (125KB). A bit is \u201c1\u201d if the corresponding checkbox is checked and \u201c0\u201d otherwise.\n\nClients store the bits in a [bitset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_array)\n (an array of bytes that makes it easy to store, access, and flip raw bits) and reference that bitset when rendering checkboxes. Clients tell the server when they check a box; the server flips the relevant bit and broadcasts that fact to all connected clients.\n\nTo avoid throwing a million elements into the DOM, clients only render the checkboxes in view (plus a small buffer) using [react-window](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-window)\n.\n\nI could have done this with a single process,I wanted an architecture that I _could_ scale (and an excuse to use Redis for the first time in years). So the actual server setup looked like this:\n\n![The original architecture of OMCB. A client connects to nginx, which reverse proxies the client to a a Flask instance. Flask interfaces with Redis.](https://eieio.games/assets/images/scaling-omcb/original-arch-reverse-proxy.png)\n\nClients hit nginx for static content, and then make a GET for the bitset state and a websocket connection (for updates); nginx (acting as a reverse proxy) forwards those requests to one of two Flask servers (run via gunicorn).\n\nState is stored in Redis, which has good primitives for flipping individual bits. Clients tell Flask when they check a box; Flask updates the bits in Redis and writes an event to a pubsub (message queue). Both Flask servers read from that pubsub and notify connected clients when checkboxes are checked/unchecked.\n\n![The original architecture of OMCB. A client connects to nginx, which reverse proxies the client to a a Flask instance. Flask interfaces with Redis.](https://eieio.games/assets/images/scaling-omcb/original-arch-request.png)\n\nWe need the pubsub because we've got two Flask instances; a Flask instance can't just broadcast \"box 2 was checked\" to its own clients.\n\nFinally, the Flask servers do simple rate-limiting (on requests per session and new sessions per IP[1](#fn:1)\n - foolishly stored in Redis!) and regularly send full state snapshots to connected clients (in case a client missed an update because, say, the tab was backgrounded).\n\nHere's an (abbreviated) implementation of the Flask side.\n\n    # This is long, so I've skipped Redis initialization, \n    # my rate limiting and logging implementation, etc.\n    \n    # You can run lua inside Redis. The lua runs atomically.\n    # It's pretty sweet.\n    set_bit_script = \"\"\"\n    local key = KEYS[1]\n    local index = tonumber(ARGV[1])\n    local value = tonumber(ARGV[2])\n    local current = redis.call('getbit', key, index)\n    local diff = value - current\n    redis.call('setbit', key, index, value)\n    redis.call('incrby', 'count', diff)\n    return diff\"\"\"\n    set_bit_sha = redis_client.script_load(set_bit_script)\n    \n    def get_bit(index):\n        return bool(redis_client.getbit('bitset', index))\n    \n    def set_bit(index, value):\n        diff = redis_client.evalsha(set_bit_sha, 1, 'bitset', index, int(value))\n        return diff != 0\n    \n    def get_full_state():\n        raw_data = redis_client.get(\"bitset\")\n        return base64.b64encode(raw_data).decode('utf-8')\n    \n    def get_count():\n        return int(redis_client.get('count') or 0)\n    \n    def publish_toggle_to_redis(index, new_value):\n        redis_client.publish('bit_toggle_channel', json.dumps({'index': index, 'value': new_value}))\n    \n    def state_snapshot():\n        full_state = get_full_state()\n        count = get_count()\n        return {'full_state': full_state, 'count': count}\n    \n    @app.route('/api/initial-state')\n    def get_initial_state():\n        return jsonify(state_snapshot())\n    \n    def emit_full_state():\n        socketio.emit('full_state', state_snapshot())\n    \n    @socketio.on('toggle_bit')\n    def handle_toggle(data):\n        if not allow_toggle(request.sid):\n            print(f\"Rate limiting toggle request for {request.sid}\")\n            return False\n        # There's a race here.

It\u2019s not even async. I haven\u2019t shipped production Python in like 8 years! But I was fine with that. I didn\u2019t think the project would be popular. This was good enough.\n\nI changed a lot of OMCB but the basic architecture - nginx reverse proxy, API workers, Redis for state and message queues - remained.\n\nPrinciples for scaling\n----------------------\n\nBefore I talk about what changed, let\u2019s look at the principles I had in mind while scaling.\n\n#### Bound my costs\n\nI needed to be able to math out an upper bound on my costs. I aimed to [let things break when they broke my expectations](https://x.com/jonchurch/status/1809307525524631621)\n instead of going serverless and scaling into bankruptcy.\n\n#### Embrace the short-term\n\nI assumed the site\u2019s popularity was fleeting. I took on technical debt and aimed for ok solutions that I could hack out in hours over great solutions that would take me days or weeks.\n\n#### Use simple, self-hosted tech\n\nI\u2019m used to running my own servers. I like to log into boxes and run commands. I tried to only add dependencies that I could run and debug on my own.\n\n#### Have fun\n\nI optimized for fun, not money. Scaling the site my way was fun. So was saying no to advertisers.\n\n#### Keep it global\n\nThe magic of the site was jumping _anywhere_ and seeing immediate changes. So I didn\u2019t want to scale by, for example, sending clients a view of only the checkboxes they were looking at[2](#fn:2)\n.\n\nDay 1: the pop\n--------------\n\nWithin [30 minutes of launch](https://x.com/itseieio/status/1805994700760830066)\n, activity looked like this:\n\nThat's a lot of checks\n\nThe site was still up, but I knew it wouldn\u2019t tolerate the load for much longer.\n\nThe most obvious improvement was more servers. Fortunately this was easy - nginx could easily reverse-proxy to Flask instances on another VM, and my state was already in Redis. I started spinning up more boxes.\n\n![Load on the second OMCB server is 100%](https://eieio.games/assets/images/scaling-omcb/load-second-server.jpeg)\n\nI spun up the second server around 12:30 PM. Load immediately hit 100%\n\nI originally assumed another server or two would be sufficient. Instead traffic grew as I scaled. I hit #1 on Hacker News; activity on my tweet skyrocketed. I looked for bigger optimizations.\n\nMy Flask servers were struggling. Redis was running out of connections (did you notice I wasn\u2019t using a connection pool?). My best idea was to batch updates - I hacked something in that looked like this:\n\nBatching logic\n\n    def handle_Redis_messages():\n        message_count = 0\n        updates = []\n        while True:\n            message = pubsub.get_message(timeout=0.01)\n            if message is None:\n                # No more messages available\n                break\n    \n            if message['type'] == 'message':\n                try:\n                    data = json.loads(message['data'])\n                    updates.append(data)\n                    message_count += 1\n                except json.JSONDecodeError:\n                    print(f\"Failed to decode message: {message['data']}\")\n    \n            if message_count >= 100:\n                break\n    \n        if message_count > 0:\n            socketio.emit('batched_bit_toggles', updates)\n            print(f\"Processed {message_count} messages\")\n\nI didn\u2019t bother with backwards compatibility. I figured folks were used to the site breaking and would just refresh.\n\nI also added a connection pool. This _definitely_ did not play nicely with gunicorn and Flask[3](#fn:3)\n, but it did seem to reduce the number of connections to Redis[4](#fn:4)\n.\n\nI also beefed up my Redis box - easy to do since I was using Digital Ocean\u2019s managed Redis - from a tiny (1 shared CPU; 2 GB RAM) instance to a box with 4 dedicated CPUs and 32 GB of RAM (I did this after Redis mysteriously went down). The resizing took about 30 minutes; the server came back up.\n\nAnd then things got trickier.\n\n### It was not a good night to have plans\n\nAt around 4:30 PM I accepted it: _I had plans._ I had spent June at [a camp at ITP](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp/camp)\n - a school at NYU[5](#fn:5)\n. And the night of the 26th was our final show. I had signed up to display a [face-controlled Pacman game](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8dJ_ZXP3yr/)\n and invited some friends - I had to go!\n\nI brought an iPad and put OMCB on it. I spun up servers while my friend [Uri](https://x.com/UriBram)\n and my girlfriend Emma kindly stepped in to explain what I was doing to strangers when they came by my booth.\n\nI had no automation for spinning up servers (oops) so my naming conventions evolved as I worked.\n\n![Droplet names for OMCB. The names become increasingly terse.](https://eieio.games/assets/images/scaling-omcb/dropletnames.png)\n\nMy servers. I ended up with 8 worker VMs\n\nI got home from the show around midnight. I was tired. But there was still more work to do, like:\n\n*   Reducing the number of Flask processes on each box (I originally had more workers than the number of cores on a box; this didn\u2019t work well)\n*   Increasing the batch size of my updates - I found that doubling the batch size substantially reduced load. I tried doubling it again. This appeared to help even more. I don\u2019t know how to pick a principled number here.\n\n### Bandwidth\n\nI pushed the updates. I was feeling good! And then I got a text from my friend [Greg Technology](https://greg.technology)\n.\n\n![A screenshot of a text message. It says 'I AM SO PROUD. R u gonna get hit w a server bill for bandwidth or is the banw not cray cray cray cray.'](https://eieio.games/assets/images/scaling-omcb/gregtext.png)\n\ngulp\n\nI realized _I hadn\u2019t thought hard enough about bandwidth._ Digital Ocean\u2019s bandwidth pricing is pretty sane ($0.01/GB after a pretty generous per-server compounding free allowance). I had a TB of free bandwidth from [past work](/nonsense/game-12-stranger-video/)\n and (pre-launch) didn\u2019t think OMCB would make a dent.\n\nI did back of the envelope math. I send state snapshots (1 million bits; 1 Mbit) every 30 seconds. With 1,000 clients that\u2019s already 2GB a minute! Or 120GB an hour. And we\u2019re probably gonna have more clients than that. And we haven\u2019t even started to think about updates.\n\nIt was 2 AM. I was very tired. I did some bad math - maybe I confused GB/hour with GB/minute? - and _freaked out_. I thought I was already on the hook for thousands of dollars!\n\nSo I did a couple of things:\n\n*   Frantically texted Greg, who helped me realize that my math was way off.\n*   Ran `ip -s link show dev eth0` on my nginx box to see how many bytes I had sent, confirming that my math was way off[6](#fn:6)\n    .\n*   Started thinking about how to reduce bandwidth - and how to cap my costs.\n\nI immediately reduced the frequency of my state snapshots, and then (with some help from Greg) pared down the size of the incremental updates I sent to clients.\n\n    // Original batch implementation\n    // (I just took the individual updates I was sending to clients and put them in a list)\n    [{ \"index\": 123, \"value\": true }, { \"index\": 124, \"value\": false }, {\"index\": 125, \"value\": true}]\n    // Final implementation - array of true values, array of false values\n    [[123, 125], [124]]\n    \n\nI moved from stuffing a bunch of dicts into a list to sending two arrays of indices with `true` and `false` implied. This was _five times shorter_ than my original implementation!\n\nAnd then I used linux\u2019s [`tc`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tc_(Linux))\n utility to slam a hard cap on the amount of data I could send per second. `tc` is famously hard to use[7](#fn:7)\n, so I wrote my configuration script with Claude\u2019s help.\n\nthe tc script\n\n    INTERFACE=eth0\n    LIMIT=250mbit\n    tc qdisc del dev $INTERFACE root\n    tc qdisc add dev $INTERFACE root handle 1: htb default 10\n    tc class add dev $INTERFACE parent 1: classid 1:1 htb rate $LIMIT\n    tc class add dev $INTERFACE parent 1:1 classid 1:10 htb rate $LIMIT\n    tc filter add dev $INTERFACE protocol ip parent 1:0 prio 1 u32 match ip dst 0.0.0.0/0 flowid 1:10\n\nThis just limits traffic flowing over eth0 (my public interface) to 250Mbit a second. That\u2019s a lot of bandwidth - ~2GB/min, or just under 3 TB a day. But it let me reason about my costs, and at $0.01/GB I knew I wouldn\u2019t go bankrupt overnight.\n\nAt around 3:30 AM I got in bed.\n\nMy server was pegged at my 250 Mb/s limit for much of the night. I originally thought I was lucky to add limits when I did; I now realize someone probably saw [my tweet](https://x.com/itseieio/status/1806206039945060364)\n about reducing bandwidth and tried to give me a huge bill.\n\n![Bandwidth usage from nginx. The server is pegged at the bandwidth lmiit for several hours](https://eieio.games/assets/images/scaling-omcb/nginx-bandwidth-cropped.png) ![A tweet. It says 'doing this again, sorry! I am significantly reducing message size to keep things snappier and avoid bankrupting myself on bandwidth costs lol'](https://eieio.games/assets/images/scaling-omcb/bandwidth-tweet.png)\n\nBlue is traffic from my workers to nginx, purple is nginx out to the world. The timing is suspicious\n\nDay 2: it\u2019s still growing\n-------------------------\n\nI woke up a few hours later. The site was down. I hadn\u2019t been validating input properly.\n\nThe site didn\u2019t prevent folks from checking boxes above 1 million. Someone had checked boxes in the hundred million range! This let them push the count of checked boxes to 1 million, tricking the site into thinking things were over[8](#fn:8)\n.\n\nRedis had also added millions of 0s (between bit one million and bit one hundred million), which 100x\u2019d the data I was sending to clients.\n\nThis was embarrassing - I\u2019m new to building for the web but like\u2026I know you should validate your inputs! But it was a quick fix. I stopped nginx, copied the first million bits of my old bitset to a new truncated bitset (I wanted to keep the old one for debugging), taught my code to reference the new bitset, and added proper validation.\n\n![The size of the old bitset and new bitset in redis. The old bitset has 12500000 bytes; the new one has 125000](https://eieio.games/assets/images/scaling-omcb/redis-truncated.png)\n\nmuch better\n\nNot too bad! I brought the site back up.\n\n### Adding a replica and portscanning my VPC\n\nThe site was _slow_. The number of checked boxes per hour quickly exceeded the day 1 peak.\n\n![Unique visitors to OMCB on day 2. The site peaks with over 20,000 unique visitors in an hour.](https://eieio.games/assets/images/scaling-omcb/hourly-unique-players-day-2.png) ![Boxes checked during OMCB's second day. Millions of boxes are being checked an hour.](https://eieio.games/assets/images/scaling-omcb/hourly-checked-boxes-day-2.png)\n\nThe biggest problem was the initial page load. This made sense - we had to hit Redis, which was under a lot of load (and we were making too many connections to it due to bugs in my connection pooling).\n\nI was tired and didn\u2019t feel equipped to debug my connection pool issues. So I embraced the short term and spun up a Redis replica to take load off the primary and spread my connections out.\n\nBut there was a problem - after spinning up the replica, I couldn\u2019t find its private IP!\n\n![Obfuscated connection details for the OMCB redis instance. Selecting 'VPC network' gives a DNS entry with the 'private' prefix](https://eieio.games/assets/images/scaling-omcb/omcb-connection-details.gif)\n\nI got my Redis instance's private IP by prepending \"private-\" to its DNS entry\n\nTo connect to my primary, I used a DNS record - there were records for its public and private IPs. Digital Ocean told me to prepend `replica-` to those records to get my replica IP. This worked for the public one, but didn\u2019t exist for the private DNS record! And I really wanted the private IP.\n\nI thought sending traffic to a public IP would risk traversing the public internet, which would mean being billed for way more bandwidth[9](#fn:9)\n.\n\nSince I couldn\u2019t figure out how to find the replica\u2019s private IP in an official way (I\u2019m sure you can! Tell me how!), I took a different approach and starting making connections to private IPs close to the IPs of my Redis primary and my other servers. This worked on the third or fourth try.\n\nThen I hardcoded that IP as my replica IP!\n\n### Stabilizing\n\nMy Flask processes kept crashing, requiring me to babysit the site. The crashes seemed to be from running out of Redis connections. I\u2019m wincing as I type this now, but I still didn\u2019t want to debug what was going on there - it was late and the problem was fuzzy.\n\nSo I wrote a script that looked at the number of running Flask processes and bounced my systemd unit if too many were down[10](#fn:10)\n.\n\nMy bash restart script\n\n    #!/bin/bash\n    \n    # We have 4 running processes. This script only restarts them if fewer than 3 are running;\n    # I figured this might help us reach a stable equilibirum.\n    \n    # jitter\n    x=$((RANDOM % 300))\n    echo \"sleeping for $x\"\n    sleep \"$x\"\n    \n    count_running_servers() {\n        ps aux | grep gunicorn | grep -oP 'bind \\K0\\.0\\.0\\.0:\\d+' | sort | uniq | wc -l\n    }\n    \n    running_servers=$(count_running_servers)\n    \n    if [ $running_servers -lt 3 ]; then\n        echo \"Less than 3 servers running. Restarting all servers...\"\n    \n        sudo systemctl stop one-million-checkboxes.service\n    \n        sleep 10\n    \n        sudo systemctl start one-million-checkboxes.service\n    \n        echo \"Servers restarted.\"\n    else\n        echo \"At least 3 servers are running. No action needed.\"\n    fi\n\nI threw that into the crontab on my boxes and updated my nginx config to briefly take servers out of rotation if they were down (I should have done this sooner!). This appeared to work pretty well. The site stabilized.\n\n### Stale updates\n\nAt around 12:30 AM I posted some stats on Twitter and got ready to go to bed. And then a user reported an issue:\n\n![A user reports a bug around the site changing surprisingly quickly](https://eieio.games/assets/images/scaling-omcb/ohgod.png)\n\nahhhhhhhhhhhh\n\nI had written a classic bug.\n\nTo keep client checkbox state synchronized, I did two things:\n\n*   Sent clients incremental updates when checkboxes were checked or unchecked\n*   Sent clients occasional full-state snapshots in case they missed an update\n\nThese updates didn\u2019t have timestamps. A client could receive a new full-state snapshot and then apply an old incremental update - resulting in them having a totally wrong view of the world until the next full-state snapshot[11](#fn:11)\n.\n\nI was embarrassed by this - I\u2019ve written a whole lot of state machine code and know better. It was almost 1 AM and I had barely slept the night before; it was a struggle to write code that I (ironically) thought I could write in my sleep. But I:\n\n*   Timestamped each full state snapshot\n*   Timestamped each update written to my Redis pubsub\n*   Added the _max_ timestamp of each incremental update in the batches I sent to clients\n*   Taught clients to drop update batches if their timestamp was behind the timestamp of the last full-state snapshot\n\nThis isn\u2019t perfect (clients can apply a batch of mostly-stale updates as long as one update is new) but it\u2019s substantially better.\n\n![The author asking Claude to double check their work. They say they're very tired.](https://eieio.games/assets/images/scaling-omcb/claude-im-tired.png)\n\nme to claude, 1 AM\n\nI ran my changes by Claude before shipping to prod. Claude\u2019s suggestions weren\u2019t actually super helpful, but talking through why they were wrong gave me more confidence.\n\nRewrite in go\n-------------\n\nI woke up the next morning and the site was still up! Hackily restarting your servers is great. This was great timing - the site was attracting more mainstream media attention (I woke up to an email from the Washington Post).\n\nI moved my attention from keeping the site up to thinking about how to wind it down. I was still confident folks wouldn\u2019t be interested in the site forever, and I wanted to provide a real ending before _everyone_ moved on[12](#fn:12)\n.\n\nI came up with a plan - I\u2019d make checked boxes freeze if they weren\u2019t unchecked quickly. I wasn\u2019t sure that my current setup could handle this - it might result in a spike of activity plus I\u2019d be asking my servers to do more work.\n\nSo (after taking a break for a day) I got brunch with my friend [Eliot](https://github.com/EliotHedeman)\n - a super talented performance engineer - and asked if he was down to give me a hand. He was, and from around 2 PM to 2 AM on Sunday we discussed implementations of my sunsetting plan and then rewrote the whole backend in go!\n\nThe go rewrite was straightforward; we ported without many changes. Lots of our sticking points were things like \u201cfinding a go `socketio` library that supports the latest version of the protocol.\u201d\n\nThe speedup was staggering.\n\n![CPU usage on a worker VM. It drops dramatically after the go deployment](https://eieio.games/assets/images/scaling-omcb/cropped-cpu-go-deployment.png)\n\nCPU usage on a worker VM\n\nThings were actually so much faster that we ended up needing to add better rate-limiting; originally we scaled too well and bots on the site were able to push absurd amounts of traffic through the site.\n\nThe site _was_ DDOS\u2019d on Sunday night, but addressing this was pretty simple - I just threw the site behind CloudFlare and updated my nginx configs a bit.\n\nSunsetting the site\n-------------------\n\nThe site was rock-solid after the go rewrite. I spent the next week doing interviews, enjoying the attention, and trying to relax.\n\nAnd then I got to work on sunsetting. Checked boxes would freeze if they weren\u2019t unchecked quickly, which would eventually leave the site totally frozen. The architecture here ended up being pretty simple - mostly some more state in Redis:\n\n![Architecture diagram. It shows a hashtable that maps box # to the last time it was checked, a frozen bitset that tracks which cells are disabled, and a time to freeze variable that represents how long before a box should be frozen](https://eieio.games/assets/images/scaling-omcb/sunset-arch.png)\n\ngod i love making diagrams in tldraw\n\nI added a hashtable that tracked the last time that a box was checked (this would be too much state to pass to clients, but was fine to keep in Redis), along with a \u201ctime to freeze\u201d value. When trying to uncheck a box, we\u2019d first check whether `now - last_checked > time_to_freeze` - if it is, we don\u2019t uncheck the box and instead update `frozen_bitset` to note that the relevant checkbox is now frozen.\n\nI distributed `frozen_bitset` state to clients the same way that I distributed which boxes were checked, and taught clients to disable a checkbox if it was in the frozen bitset. And I added a job to periodically search for bits that _should_ be frozen (but weren\u2019t yet because nobody had tried to uncheck them) and freeze those.\n\nRedis made it soooo easy to avoid race conditions with this implementation - I put all the relevant logic into a Lua script, meaning that it all ran atomically! Redis is great.\n\nmy lua script\n\n    local bitset_key = KEYS[1]\n    local count_key = KEYS[2]\n    local frozen_bitset_key = KEYS[3]\n    local frozen_count_key = KEYS[4]\n    local freeze_time_key = KEYS[5]\n    local index = tonumber(ARGV[1])\n    local max_count = tonumber(ARGV[2])\n    \n    local UNCHECKED_SENTINEL = 0\n    local redis_time = redis.call('TIME')\n    local current_time = tonumber(redis_time[1]) * 1000 + math.floor(tonumber(redis_time[2]) / 1000)\n    local freeze_time = tonumber(redis.call('get', freeze_time_key) or \"0\")\n    \n    local current_count = tonumber(redis.call('get', count_key) or \"0\")\n    local current_bit = redis.call('getbit', bitset_key, index)\n    local frozen_bit = redis.call('getbit', frozen_bitset_key, index)\n    \n    if frozen_bit == 1 then\n        -- Return current bit value, 0 for no change, and 0 to indicate not newly frozen\n        return {current_bit, 0, 0}\n    end\n    \n    if current_count >= max_count then\n        return {current_bit, 0, 0}\n    end\n    \n    local new_bit = 1 - current_bit\n    local diff = new_bit - current_bit\n    \n    -- If we're unchecking (new_bit == 0), check the freeze_time\n    if new_bit == 0 then\n        local last_checked = tonumber(redis.call('hget', 'last_checked', index) or UNCHECKED_SENTINEL)\n        if last_checked ~= UNCHECKED_SENTINEL and current_time - last_checked >= freeze_time then\n            -- Box is frozen, update frozen bitset and count\n            redis.call('setbit', frozen_bitset_key, index, 1)\n            redis.call('incr', frozen_count_key)\n            -- Return 1 (checked), 0 for no change, and 1 to indicate newly frozen\n            return {1, 0, 1}\n        else\n            redis.call('hset', 'last_checked', index, UNCHECKED_SENTINEL)\n        end\n    else\n        -- We're checking the box, update last_checked time\n        redis.call('hset', 'last_checked', index, current_time)\n    end\n    \n    redis.call('setbit', bitset_key, index, new_bit)\n    local new_count = current_count + diff\n    redis.call('set', count_key, new_count)\n    \n    -- new bit value, the change (-1, 0, or 1), and 0 to indicate not newly frozen\n    return {new_bit, diff, 0}  \n\nI rolled the sunsetting changes 2 weeks and 1 day after I launched OMCB. Box 491915 was checked at 4:35 PM Eastern on July 11th, closing out the site.\n\nSo what\u2019d I learn?\n------------------\n\nWell, a lot. This was the second time that I\u2019d put a server with a \u2018real\u2019 backend on the public internet, and [the last one](/nonsense/game-12-stranger-video/)\n barely counted. Learning in a high-intensity but low-stakes environment is great[13](#fn:13)\n.\n\nBuilding the site in two days with little regard for scale was a good choice. It\u2019s so hard to know what will do well on the internet - nobody I explained the site to seemed that excited about it - and I doubt I would have launched at all if I spent weeks thinking about scale. Having a bunch of eyes on the site energized me to keep it up and helped me focus on what mattered.\n\nI\u2019m happy with the tech that I used. Redis and nginx are incredible. Running things myself made debugging and fixing things so much easier (it was a little painful to not have full control of my Redis instance). The site cost me something like $850 to run - [donations](https://buymeacoffee.com/eieio)\n came pretty close to that, so I\u2019m not in the hole for too much.\n\nIn the future I might spend some time trying to decode the pricing pages for [convex](https://www.convex.dev/pricing)\n or [durable objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/platform/pricing/)\n. But I\u2019m proud of scaling it on my own terms, and I think it\u2019s worth noting that things worked out ok.\n\nThis also validated my belief that people are hungry for constrained anonymous interactions with strangers. I love building sites like this (and I was gonna build more regardless!) but I\u2019m more confident than ever that it\u2019s a good idea.\n\nWrapping up\n-----------\n\nThis was an absolute blast.\n\nI\u2019ve got one more story to tell about the site. It\u2019s about teens doing cool things. This blog is too long to tell it right now, so stay tuned (I\u2019ll update my [newsletter](https://eieio.substack.com/)\n, [twitter](https://twitter.com/itseieio)\n, and [various other platforms](/whats-my-deal/)\n) when it\u2019s live.\n\nAnd in the meantime - build more stupid websites! The internet can still be fun :)\n\n1.  I was aiming to strike a balance between \u201cletting someone trivially spam the whole site\u201d and \u201cletting a bunch of students behind the same IP play at all\u201d - which is why I did this instead of just limiting per IP. I later gave up on this approach, although if I had more time I would have tried to keep it in.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:1)\n    \n2.  With sufficient time I could have potentially implemented something that only sent clients \u201crelevant\u201d data but updated its notion of \u201crelevant\u201d fast enough to keep the magic - but per \u201cembrace the short-term\u201d I didn\u2019t think I could deliver a good enough experience there fast enough.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:2)\n    \n3.  This is almost certainly a bad interaction between running a pre-fork web server, Python threading, and the background jobs for pushing out state snapshots and updates that I was running. I can imagine lots of problems here! I never got to the bottom of the issue (I just switched to golang instead :)) but if it\u2019s obvious to you I\u2019d love to hear about it!\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:3)\n    \n4.  I also ripped out my rate-limiting around session creation. It was stored in Redis, I was exhausting my Redis connections, and clients weren\u2019t opening lots of sessions - just sending lots of data for a single session. This was definitely risky! But I think it was worth it in the short term. A few nights in and a little delirious, [I described this poorly on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40806976)\n    . My bad explanation was kinda funny.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:4)\n    \n5.  This blog is too long for me to talk about ITP camp at length but - it\u2019s really fun! ITP specializes in just the type of weird tech-art bullshit that I love. I met a ton of cool people there and had a blast. Consider checking it out :)\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:5)\n    \n6.  One nice thing about using a single nginx reverse proxy is that it was really easy to reason about how much bandwidth I was using! It could basically only come from one nic.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:6)\n    \n7.  I happen to be familiar with `tc` from a job I had a decade ago! So I still had the muscle memory for inspecting qdiscs. But there was no way I could have written a valid filter without help.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:7)\n    \n8.  The UI was also meant to freeze, but only if the count of checked boxes was _exactly_ 1 million. Because of a race condition the count was _above_ 1 million so it didn\u2019t freeze. I think this was pretty lucky; interest might have died off if the UI froze.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:8)\n    \n9.  This would be particularly annoying because public traffic would no longer be egressing from a single instance! Also I\u2019m not _sure_ this would be a problem; maybe DO would be smart about routing or smart enough not to bill me. But I didn\u2019t want to find out.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:9)\n    \n10.  I was running several Flask processes via one systemd unit and I think systemd wouldn\u2019t bring the process back up unless they all crashed? I\u2019m not sure.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:10)\n    \n11.  I suspect adding a replica aggravated this problem because my servers were doing a better job of sending out updates.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:11)\n    \n12.  I actually missed pretty hard here, and I think the experience would have been better if I shipped the changes sooner.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:12)\n    \n13.  My favorite example of this - during the rewrite, Eliot and I mistakenly thought we had dropped the prod database. We panicked - we\u2019ve been engineers for a while! dropping prod is bad! But then I realized that I could just\u2026tweet out \u201chey, sorry, I dropped the database. You\u2019re gonna have to recheck the boxes\u201d and it\u2019d be fine? That\u2019s kinda funny? This was freeing.\u00a0[\u21a9](#fnref:13)\n    \n\n[](/essays/scaling-one-million-checkboxes/)\n\n_get new posts via [twitter](https://twitter.com/itseieio)\n, [substack](https://eieio.substack.com/)\n, [rss](/feed.xml)\n, or [a billion other platforms](/whats-my-deal)\n  \nor subscribe to my newsletter right from this page!_\n\n[![Logo](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_170,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:best,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c1be999-f401-4a0e-b373-21ca05f375be_128x128.png)](https://eieio.substack.com/)\n\n[eieio games](https://eieio.substack.com/)\n\n===========================================\n\ngames and experiments made for the internet of the 2000s\n\nBy nolen\n\nSubscribe\n\nBy subscribing you agree to [Substack's Terms of Use](https://eieio.substack.com/tos?utm_source=embed_publication)\n, [our Privacy Policy](https://eieio.substack.com/privacy?utm_source=embed_publication)\n and [our Information collection notice](https://substack.com/ccpa?utm_source=embed_publication#personal-data-collected)\n\n[![Substack](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_200,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Fsubstack_wordmark.black.png)](https://substack.com/?utm_source=embed&utm_content=eieio)\n\n-----\nGenerate comments in a hierarchical structure with 3 comments per level, up to a depth of 3."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n- **pizzafeelsright** (): Many lessons learned along with great historical knowledge of (distributed) systems.<p>I think you hit every type of interruption and point of failure, except storage space, and it is great to see your resolutions.<p>I wasn&#x27;t aware Redis could do the Lua stuff which makes me very interested in using it as an alternative state.<p>As for the bandwidth - one of my biggest gripes with cloud services as there is no hard limit to avoid billing overages.\n  - **eieio** (): Thank you!<p>FWIW I certainly hit storage space in some boring ways - I didn&#x27;t have a good logrotate setup so I almost ran out of disk, and I sent my box-check logs to Redis and had to set something up to offload old logs to disk to not break Redis.

The automotive field is a case in point._\n\n[*   Intro](#intro)\n[*   The three basic problems all tools try to solve](#three-problems)\n[*   Automotive has special tools and languages for everything](#automotive-tools)\n[*   The need to interact with a running system childbirths more tools](#live-systems)\n[*   A language is not just its syntax but the tools and environment around it](#language-environment)\n[*   Rules and processes are enforced with non-formal methods](#non-formal-methods)\n[*   Domain specific languages are everywhere](#dsls)\n[*   Move away from the language completely and just click buttons](#autosar)\n[*   The future: self-driving cars go all in on DSLs](#the-future)\n[*   Conclusion](#conclusion)\n\nIntro\n-----\n\nThe fearsome Lisp macros and other aliens brought to life by the Lisp parentheses often get the blame for breeding a style of software development rich in abstractions and [domain specific languages](https://wiki.c2.com/?StumblingBlocksForDomainSpecificLanguages)\n in contrast to the easily recognizable C-like creatures. What is not officially admitted is that in any project or industry of sufficient size, an overabundance of better, improved, simple, easy to use tools, programming languages, standards and best practices are employed and brought to life in an ah-hoc manner. A confirmation of [Greenspun's Tenth Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun's_tenth_rule)\n, if you will. Though the motivation behind this proliferation be that this is just the way things are or that the project is just too complex, part of reason lies in the use of programming languages that lack power, extensibility and interactivity.\n\nI'll look at the automotive industry which relies solely on the C programming language, at least on the surface, and bring to light these hidden creatures. When a people is not powerful enough to rule the whole continent, every beggar together with their pack of hideous horses vies for their neighbor's riches. The landscape is fractured and tens of languages and dialects are spoken. All journeys take much longer than usual. Pacts, alliances and agreements for safe passage with all tribe leaders need to be signed and constantly updated. One sees in their voyage countless rituals none better or more widespread than the other. Without a powerful language to hold it all together, the automotive world is also split into pieces with each wannabe king claiming it has found the path to the happy life and deserves to mount the throne. Watch for this sign in what follows and for the three main problems all these tools try to solve once and for all.\n\nThe three basic problems all tools try to solve\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nFirstly, how to find out what your application is doing in real time once it is up and running. How to check your assumptions, backtrack, readjust and try again, how to have access to as many parts of the running system as possible and how to modify anything without slowing down your pace, like a road cyclist who doesn't need to stop at every curb to change gears and loose momentum. How to achieve all this seamlessly and concentrate on the project itself and not the tooling and the irrelevant problems around it. In short, how to be one with the system at all stages of development with as few interruptions as possible.\n\nSecondly, how to come up with more intuitive and powerful means to develop, express and even comprehend whole software systems above the minutest details of algorithms and if's and else's. The classic can't see the forest for the trees idiom. What does the system do at a higher level? How it is organized? How can I easily and meaningfully change it without going into too much pointer arithmetic details? How do I speak about it, how do I cram it all up inside my brain to aid my understanding and explore it in my mind or with my colleagues and clients to better get the message across and align on goals and purposes. Ideally, it would be in a language closer to English or a language that everybody speaks fluently or even something visual I can slurp up all at once, like a painting that I can glance instantly and not a book that takes weeks to read, though of course, now I need some training or experience in the arts to understand anything and there are myriads of interpretation of those brushes before my eyes. But still, a language that is formally verifiable and able to be evaluated by a computer without much intervention from my side. This is the heart of abstraction towers and of domain specific languages. Many tools try to solve this problem without even knowing it.\n\nLastly, how to organize everything around the main programming language. What tools are best for building or packaging your software, what tools for writing code and how to settle on a definition of best. How to organizing teams, agree on standards, writing style, where to keep requirements and how to keep them in sync with the implementation. How to make sure everyone is on the same page regarding the language features, how to use those features in a standard way and what to avoid, either because one wants to prevent different ways of doing things or because some of those things are really dangerous. How to solve the shortage of qualified people problem which branches into how to make things more beginner friendly, easier and intuitive by avoiding C pointers and C macros and recursion, for example and by employing GUI tools and code generators that avoid these pitfalls. Only to fall into different mousetraps, of course.\n\nAll solutions, the problems they beget and again the solutions to fix them in this never-ending circle all spring from these initial needs and wants.\n\nAutomotive has special tools and languages for everything\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nA car's software is split into dedicated [ECU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_control_unit)\ns, each controlling the seats, windows or engine, among others. These microcontrollers with memory and peripherals and developed independently by different teams are all connected by a single communication network and exchange thousands of uniquely identified [CAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus)\n messages each second. To simplify, each ECU behaves like a server, and the list of messages it sends and receives represents its API. These are the microservices of the automotive world, if you will.\n\nAt a minimum, an ECU must receive wake-up and periodic CAN messages from other ECUs to function properly. In the development phase, where these other ECUs are physically missing from one's desk, an engineer needs to simulate them in software together with the ability to sniff out CAN messages from their physical ECU, similar to what a [Wireshark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireshark)\n user sniffing network packets does. In a first sign of wannabe sole rulers across wast landscapes, Vector's [CANoe](https://www.vector.com/int/en/products/products-a-z/software/canoe/)\n, is the only tool for all development and test tasks and a versatile tool for the development, testing and analysis of entire ECU networks as well as individual ECUs.\n\nIn my experience, at the start of any new project it best to first discover the project at the fastest speed possible, with the full knowledge that my initial solution will not be correct and most of my code will not even survive the first few iterations. The classic build one to throw one away idiom. These iterations will help understand and even rewrite some of my initial assumptions. In extreme cases even to confirm that what I'm trying to develop is useless or impossible to build. This then is the first step in developing a software product or probably any handiwork. CANoe, and plenty of other tools in this field, confirms this need and that C is not the right tool to be going out exploring dangerous paths in the middle of the night,\n\n> At the beginning of the development process, CANoe is used to create simulation models which simulate the behavior of the ECUs. Over the further course of ECU development, these models serve as the basis for analysis, testing and the integration of bus systems and ECUs. This makes it possible to detect problems early and correct them. Graphic and text based analysis windows are provided for evaluating the results.\n> \n> [CANoe: Product Information](https://cdn.vector.com/cms/content/products/canoe/canoe/docs/Product%20Informations/CANoe_ProductInformation_EN.pdf)\n\nTo aid this purpose, CANoe's [simulation panel](https://cdn.vector.com/cms/content/products/canoe/canoe/graphics/Gallery/CANoe14_Simulation_gallery_EN.jpg)\n contains a visual representation of a car's network and the attached ECUs with the intention of simulating the whole car before writing any C code. Each ECU can be clicked around and programmed in [CAPL](https://www.vector.com/us/en/know-how/capl/)\n, an event-driven programming language developed by Vector. It has C-like syntax, intentionally chosen to make C developers feel right at home, as Vector notes, while also acknowledging is doesn't introduce any groundbreaking ideas or abstractions. Instead, it tries to make life easier for engineers: the goal of CAPL has always been to solve specific tasks as simply as possible. Typical tasks are reacting to received messages, checking and setting signal values and sending messages. A program should restrict itself to precisely these things and not require any additional overhead. The [CAPL know-how](https://www.vector.com/int/en/know-how/capl/)\n page has all the details.\n\nThis software [modeling](https://www.google.com/search?q=model%20based%20development)\n and the introduction of new, easier, intuitive, even graphical languages and interfaces similar in style to what one is already familiar with is a recurring theme throughout this journey. Watch out for it.\n\nCANoe's [trace panel](https://cdn.vector.com/cms/content/products/canoe/canoe/graphics/Gallery/CANoe17.3_Analysis_gallery_EN.jpg)\n displays all the messages on a CAN network, the sniffing requirement I've mentioned above. All messages have unique ids and each message's payload contains one or more signals that are attached a predefined meaning, like _ignition\\_on_ or _vehicle\\_speed_. Thus, on receiving a CAN message, a hypothetical ECU implementation in C would first check its id in a big switch case, let's say. If the id is from the approved list of messages, C goes on and reads the payload. We can imagine getters and setters for such signals, like _getIgnitionStatus_ or a periodically called function like _sendVehicleSpeed_ that sends this info out on the CAN network for all the other ECUs to see. All this data about ids, messages and signals can be hard coded, but if it would, CANoe and similar tools would have a hard time deciphering what are essentially just bytes on a wire and the user would, in the best scenario, only see hexadecimal values in their graphical interfaces. They would have to either check the source code to see what they mean or some kind of a table like an excel sheet shared by all team members where all message ids and signals are kept together and assigned human-readable tags and extra info. So to make life easier for everyone the list of all CAN messages available on a network, together with the ECUs that send or receive them is kept in a [dbc](http://mcu.so/Microcontroller/Automotive/dbc-file-format-documentation_compress.pdf)\n database that is then used by both the C implementation and the visual tools, a proprietary file format also developed by Vector. I've put the easier part into quotes. Every time I see something advertised as easy and intuitive I'm seeing green meadows and leafy forests, blood-sucking ticks waiting in the ambush.\n\nTake a look at a [dbc file example](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ecu-0.0.8/src/src/j1939_utf8.dbc)\n. Not human readable. The handling of these databases which, by the way, are now officially part of the project's requirements and managed by the client, is done with yet another tool: [CANdb](https://www.vector.com/int/en/products/products-a-z/software/candb/)\n. Interestingly, dbc files do not contain the default values nor the interval at which signals must be sent, so this extra info is kept in some other medium, like [excel files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48151369/how-to-generate-signal-possible-values-from-dbc-as-a-generic-output-with-capl)\n, as seen it in practice.\n\nBut see what problem this need of ours to express CAN messages in a human-readable format introduces? Now the list of CAN messages is extracted away from the implementation language, extracted and expressed in a format the C language does not understand. As a result, every time the client updates the database, the developer has to manually translate each and every message from the dbc and excel sheets back to source code. A developer's job, after all. Only this code is quite repetitive, huge, prone to fat fingers errors and really boring. All messages have the same structure only different names and different byte-orderings. The sane way is to let code generators do this job. But code generators are already a new language, the language they're implemented in and the language of how to use them. A rift has suddenly appeared out of the blue.\n\nClimb up that high mountain and observe the king's country. C is the implementation language for an ECU that handles well-structured CAN messages. Nothing fancy. But the need to display and send those messages from external tools, possibly through scripting languages, the need to handle these messages with tools that don't require programming skills, the need to gather them into a single file easy to peruse, talk about and exchange between teams, all these needs forces the list of such messages outside of the implementation language, outside of C. If C's syntax, with no outside help, would be able to express such and use such a list to generate its own functions, interfaces and header files from it, that is if C would be able to write C, then these extra tools, dbc files, excel sheets and extra build steps would not be needed. CANoe or any other tools on their part could use use this well-formatted list for their own needs. Even better, if that format would be human-readable as C code should be, even creating, editing, searching, diff-ing and reading these files in one's text editor, would be possible without extra tools. But that is not the case, and so, we have a fine display of foot soldiers instead of a beautiful white horse.\n\nTo finish this discussion in glory and to confirm in the reader's eyes that in this particular case the introduction of a new language brings nothing really new just a slightly different syntax, check out the CAPL example from Vector's [Tips and tricks for the use of CAPL](https://support.vector.com/sys_attachment.do?sys_id=a5a6bc0e1bfe18948e9a535c2e4bcb9b)\n.\n\nAs a side node, Vector considers C macros too powerful, though they don't shy away from their own macro flavors to aid in writing generic programs,\n\n> The preprocessor is a powerful tool in the C language, but it can also lead to confusion and consequently to errors. Therefore, only a subset of the well-known preprocessor directives in C is offered in CAPL with comparable semantics \\[...\\] In CAPL, there are a number of predefined macros that are available to users for use in the code or for conditional compiling. Macros for use in the code can be used anywhere in the code without restriction. In contrast to C, macros may be used freely within string constants, identifiers for variables, and function names. They always begin and end with a % character, and they are primarily used to write generic programs.\n> \n> [Tips and tricks for the use of CAPL](https://cdn.vector.com/cms/content/know-how/_technical-articles/CAPL_2_CANNewsletter_201409_PressArticle_EN.pdf)\n\nI've simplified things a bit for the sake of discussion and considered only CAN networks thus far, but it is worth mentioning that when there are other networks present as they usually are, dbc files are not enough. They can't express Lin, FlexRay, MOST or Ethernet networks. An new, xml-based file format is needed for that: [FIBEX](https://hal.science/hal-02275436/document)\n. A first hint that [xml is quite popular](https://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/lisp.html)\n for parentheses naysayers and a confirmation that the landscape is truly split into little kingdoms. I will quote a big chunk from the standard since it reiterates some of the things I've already covered and as such it might aid up the reader's understanding,\n\n> A single cluster (ECU) can transfer several hundred or even thousands of shared signals. A network can contain several clusters that are interconnected via so called gateways that transfer signals between them. Many protocols used within the different clusters have been developed to support the different needs of a wide range of applications. Among them are CAN, LIN, FlexRay, and MOST. Obviously, the importance of communication technologies has been increased dramatically.\n> \n> Databases are necessary to store the information of all signals and their parameters in order to manage efficiently these networks. That data is used for various design and verification steps. Many dedicated tools have shown up on the market to support that. However, their application focus may differ. Unfortunately, no common format for the exchange of data between different tools is presently available. The growing number of signals in a reasonable network yields an increasing demand for a straightforward way to exchange data to avoid an error prone manual handling of redundant data. Furthermore, the fast-growing communication requirements of the implemented functions result into an increasing number of new, extended, and more dedicated tools. This increases the need for an exchange format that supports better data handling.\n> \n> FIBEX is an XML data structure that can describe a complete network within one file. This data generally includes definitions of signals, frames, clusters, and ECUs sending and receiving the signals. FIBEX can be used to transfer network information between different tools. It is not intended to replace but to supplement established standards that are often used to store data locally. The coexistence with existing formats is regarded as an advantage since available tools and standards can still be used. FIBEX provides a bridge between them.\n> \n> FIBEX\u2019 strength is seen in the field of tool integration, data exchange, and data integrity. It is \u201cmore powerful\u201d than most of the more dedicated formats. For example a single instance can contain the description of clusters with different protocols as well as the transfer function of the gateway between them. FIBEX should be used as an extension whenever the specific format is not sufficient. Since many tool vendors have announced to support FIBEX, a conversion between FIBEX and specific formats should be well supported.\n> \n> [FIBEX \u2013 An Exchange Format for Networks Based on Field Busses](https://hal.science/hal-02275436/document)\n>   \n> [ASAM MCD-2 NET](https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/mcd-2-net)\n\nThe need to interact with a running system childbirths more tools\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn a [perfect world](https://stevelosh.com/blog/2018/08/a-road-to-common-lisp/#s16-lisp-as-a-system)\n I can play with a running system directly from my text editor. I can change variables and check their values, I can call any function from anywhere and display, save and modify the return result of such calls instantly, I can scribble wild ideas directly in code with as little ceremony as possible, I can modify, update and define new functions on the go, all this without the need of extra tools, rebuild and restart steps. All the code is available at my fingertips, all features before my eyes, no hidden parts, no forbidden areas, perfect freedom, all cards on the table, both hands on the keyboard. What a joy!\n\nIn the real world the hints of such joys start with a debugger but these joys are soon wrecked. Debuggers understand these time consuming, focus-assassins and debilitating code change, rebuild, restart cycles,\n\n> The classic debugging technique is to simply add trace code to the program to print out values of variables as the program executes \\[...\\] First of all, this approach requires a constant cycle of strategically adding trace code, recompiling the program, running the program and analyzing the output of the trace code, removing the trace code after the bug is fixed, and repeating these steps for each new bug that is discovered. This is highly time consuming and fatigue making. Most importantly, these actions distract you from the real task and reduce your ability to focus on the reasoning process necessary to find the bug.\n> \n> [The Art of Debugging with GDB, DDD, and Eclipse](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Debugging-GDB-DDD-Eclipse-ebook/dp/B002N3M6U4)\n\nBut debuggers only temporarily avoid the cycle, as any code changes still involve a rebuild. And they introduce new tools able to examine the state of a running system, tools with their own special terminology, user interfaces and scripting languages. On this last point, haven't you noticed that every intuitive, simple to understand, button-clicking tool is heaven in its birthing phases and can act as the true savior for a while? Until things get serious, at which point a real programming language is always produced for those repetitive or error-prone tasks. Windows people have figured that out and turned this problem into [fortunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UiPath)\n. [Figma](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41061237)\n people as well. [Visual programming](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14482988)\n to make life easier?! Regardless, the automotive world doesn't lack such scripting languages as each vendor promotes a different debugger for their own special microcontrollers. I'll mention Lauterbach's [PRACTICE](https://support.lauterbach.com/downloads/files/practice-reference-card-pdf-2)\n scripting language with its ancient [GOTO statements](https://www2.lauterbach.com/pdf/practice_user.pdf)\nand macros of three different kinds (local, global or private) and even recursive macros. Macros' crusaders surely like the idea of macros. Check the documentation for the details.\n\nThere are alternatives to the use of debuggers in the automotive field, none better nor powerful enough to conquer all the other tribes, as I've already hinted in the introduction, not even the debugger itself. I'll look at two of them.\n\nFirstly, the [Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microrain-zh/uds_protocol/master/ISO_14229-1_2013.en.PDF.pdf)\n or Diag, for short. It's a feature all ECUs must implement by law and it allows a car shop to configure, update, and check the ECU's status. Diag is still about sending CAN messages, or routines in Diag-speak. These are standardized messages used to read certain memory addresses, predefined identifiers which are mapped to variables in the C implementation, as well as to write them. In short, poke your ECU like it was a server with all kinds of GET or POST requests and [check its response](https://cdn.vector.com/cms/content/products/canoe/canoe/graphics/Gallery/CANoe15_Diagnostics_gallery_EN.jpg)\n in CANoe's or other vendor's intuitive [Diag](https://www.vector.com/int/en/products/products-a-z/software/canoe/diagnostics/)\n interface. The 400 pages long ISO standard has all the details,\n\n> Modern vehicles have a diagnostic interface for off-board diagnostics, which makes it possible to connect a computer (client) or diagnostics tool, which is referred to as tester, to the communication system of the vehicle. Thus, UDS requests can be sent to the controllers which must provide a response (this may be positive or negative). This makes it possible to interrogate the fault memory of the individual control units, to update them with new firmware, have low-level interaction with their hardware (e.g. to turn a specific output on or off), or to make use of special functions (referred to as routines) to attempt to understand the environment and operating conditions of an ECU to be able to diagnose faulty or otherwise undesirable behavior.\n> \n> [Wikipedia: Unified Diagnostic Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Diagnostic_Services)\n>   \n\nIn a shocking move, the dbc file format we've already seen is not designed to hold Diag messages though Diag messages are still just CAN messages. At 500 pages long, the ODX standard introduces a new xml-based file format to fill this gap,\n\n> The ODX specification contains the data model to describe all diagnostic data of a vehicle and physical ECU, e.g. diagnostic trouble codes, data parameters, identification data, input/output parameters, ECU configuration (variant coding) data and communication parameters. ODX is described in Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and the data exchange format uses XML.\n> \n> [ISO 22901-1: Road vehicles - Open diagnostic data exchange (ODX)](https://libgen.li/ads.php?md5=c5d5a0dc51624268ded4b34c632ec846)\n\nIn a rare admission of a war campaign gone wrong, or to smear its adversaries and push its own solutions, Vector recognizes this is a complex beast one dares not tame with bare hands,\n\n> Until now, the process of creating ODX data has been restricted to just a limited circle of experts, due to its complexity. The current specification encompasses almost 400 pages. Users of the ODX data would rather concentrate on their actual task, namely the development of diagnostic applications, without having to deal with the specification or the data format and its dialects. With suitable tool support this is possible.\n> \n> [ODX in Practice: Experiences, challenges and potential](https://cdn.vector.com/cms/content/know-how/_technical-articles/diagnostics/ODX_HanserAutomotive_200612_PressArticle_EN.pdf)\n\nThe suitable tool is Vector's [CANdelaStudio](https://www.vector.com/int/en/products/products-a-z/software/candelastudio)\n. In a surprise move, the Diag data is not saved in the ODX format, as expected, but in its own proprietary CDD (CANdelaStudio Diagnostic Description) file format. It's the hunting season for file formats! The advantages section mentions that CDD files can be exported to other formats like CSV, HTML, ODX, RTF, XML, [a2l](https://www.vector.com/at/en/products/application-areas/ecu-calibration/a2l-data-description)\n, DEXT or CDI (I couldn't find what this is). I'll quote Autosar's DEXT, and come back to Autosar itself later in this article, since it give some reasons why even ODX is not sufficient for all needs and even new standards and formats are needed,\n\n> The market shows a high demand for transferring diagnostic demands to \\[...\\] suppliers. In the past, due to the absence of integral options, many file formats like ODX or EcuC were often used. But neither ODX nor EcuC is well suited to transfer this information. For example, ODX lacks in fault memory details and EcuC has a very generic nature that renders the enforcement of a strict model formalization very difficult. Therefore, the obvious solution approach has been to define a new standardized AUTOSAR exchange format on diagnostic functionality that can be used similar to a System Description, formalized as an ARXML file.\n> \n> [AUTOSAR: Diagnostic Extract Template](https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/standards/R20-11/CP/AUTOSAR_TPS_DiagnosticExtractTemplate.pdf)\n\nI've seen examples on the rigidness of these tools. Sometimes people want to highlight the features to be implemented in the next release or make some notes around them. Other times the team would ask the client if this or that Diag service can be added or this or that CAN message added, removed or modified, either because it was really wrong or because it was an internal message the team relies on. Since these visual tools do not provide the features to annotate, copy/paste, modify or comment out things, the teams relies on word documents, excel sheets, emails or just video calls and drawings on screen. With these, the places where one finds the project requirements increases as well, only because these languages developed to extend the original stiff language, are themselves not extendable by their users.\n\nDiag still doesn't solve the development speed problem. It has access to some predefined variables for reading and writing. It can call out functions through these Diag routines and all this helps. When one of these variables or some part of the code you're currently developing is not callable through any Diag routine, the solution is to implement such a routine which requires knowledge of how the Diag module works, something that might be outside your actual problem you're trying to solve. This still bring us back to a rebuild and reflash cycle.\n\nSecondly, the other alternative to a Debugger is Calibration. A new protocol and a new standard. A way to modify configuration options, or memory addresses, in a running ECU without touching the code The absence of any features to do so without recompiling the whole project is clearly stated as the motivation behind the standard,\n\n> The calibration of parameters is an essential part of ECU software development. Once a new set of parameters has been determined, the next development step is to run tests in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the calibration. For this purpose, internal variables are read from memory and transferred to a system that displays the data in a human-readable format.\n> \n> In the early days of ECU development, the values of calibration parameters were directly modified in the source code. Variables had to be made available for data logging in the source code as well. Every change to parameters or the list of measurable variables required modifications in the source code, re-compilation and flashing of the ECU.\n> \n> As the control software grew in complexity \\[...\\] this process became too cumbersome and slow. Additionally, the process of measurement & calibration needed to be separated from the process of software development, because a calibration engineer would need to change a parameter value or would want to record the values from a measurement variable, he had to ask the software developer to compile a new software version for him. This is the fundamental motivation for the group of ASAM MCD standards. The MCD standard provided the way to abstract the calibration from the physical memory locations.\n> \n> [ASAM MCD-2 MC](https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/mcd-2-mc/wiki/)\n\nCANoe's [AMD/XCP](https://cdn.vector.com/cms/content/know-how/_technical-articles/CANoe_AMD_XCP_PressArticle_201812_EN.pdf)\n plugin offers another perspective on this issue,\n\n> Option AMD/XCP extends CANoe by adding the ability to access ECU memory. This access is done via the ASAM-standardized XCP or CCP protocol and is convenient to configure with files in A2L format.\n> \n> CANoe offers access to internal ECU values via XCP/CCP for testing and analysis tasks. In contrast to the pure blackbox test, in which only the external ECU signals are stimulated and measured, internal values can also be calibrated and evaluated over XCP/CCP. Changes to these parameters lead to specific error states, and the resulting ECU behavior can be tested directly. It is also possible to test different variants of ECU software \u2013 switching is performed directly over XCP. Missing sensor values can also be simulated by writing values to the relevant memory locations via XCP/CCP.\n> \n> [CANoe: Product Information](https://cdn.vector.com/cms/content/products/canoe/canoe/docs/Product%20Informations/CANoe_ProductInformation_EN.pdf)\n\nAn a2l file contains all the memory addresses we want to be able to read and write together with a meaning attached to each address, the size and the type of data one expects to find there (here is a [a2l example file](https://github.com/christoph2/pyA2L/blob/18db093f9856a51d304dcde05f84b3d6e63b3d62/examples/example-a2l-file.a2l)\n and [ASAM's downloads section](https://www.asam.net/index.php?eID=dumpFile&t=f&f=2132&token=1672c6611f14141ae705140149a9401141821de0)\n offers additional examples). Functions that transform from one type of data to another are also defined in such files as there is a conversion of types between the target (ECU, C implementation) and the tools that use that data in a human-readable format. For complex transformations where a real programming language is needed, the standard mentions a way to specify Windows DLL files in the a2l files. No mention of Linux, for example. Additionally the transfer protocol (XCP or CCP) between the PC must also be specified by a metalanguage (AML). This is the same rift we've seen before. Simplistically, one side needs to know what to ask for and to know how to interpret the response once it receives it; the other side needs to know where to look for the requested information. In the middle, someone must take care that the message gets across the valley through some medium (XCP or CCP),\n\n> To convert the ECU internal characteristic and measurement implementation values into physical values, ASAM MCD-2 MC describes computation methods for their conversion between both representations. Calibration engineers can work with the ECU data in a familiar format without having to understand ECU-internal data formats. Software engineers can provide this data to them or even get the description files automatically generated from code generators. An include mechanism ensures that description files can originate from different sources.\n> \n> The ECU normally stores the measurement and calibration quantities internally in an implementation optimized format. This format is very often a fixed-point format. Outside the ECU physical models are used. The standard describes by so-called record layouts how data are stored inside the ECU and which computation methods are needed to transform the ECU internal data representation into the physical one and vice versa.\n> \n> The standard also allows to describe and configure the ECU interfaces or vendor specific extensions by a meta description language (AML). For ASAM standardized ECU interfaces, such as CCP and XCP the content of these AML parts are also standardized. But there are also a lot of vendor specific instantiations in the market which use this mechanism.\n> \n> Measurement and calibration systems are normally only used during development phase of ECUs. They allow a direct, address-oriented write and read-access but also a synchronous, continuous measurement access to ECU internal variables.\n> \n> [ASAM MCD-2 MC (ASAP2 / A2L) - Data Model for ECU Measurement and Calibration (Version 1.7.1)](https://pdfcoffee.com/download/asam-ae-mcd-2-mc-bs-v1-7-1-pdf-free.html)\n\nThis is another non-human readable file format to be handled only with tools. Since the memory addresses in a2l files are hard coded, any C code change that results in a change of allocated addresses after a build must lead to a change in the a2l file as well, or we'll read and write a different location than the one we'd expect to. This step is done with code generator tools, as confirmed even by the official documentation.\n\nTools and standards, a protocol (XCP, not CAN) and a file format (a2l) are needed to access what are practically variables from a running application,\n\n> With the XCP protocol standardized by ASAM, the user can read individual values directly from the ECU as needed. Once the A2L file has been configured and the necessary values selected, CANoe automatically acquires them and maps them as system variables. The user can then use these variables in any of the testing tasks. Besides offering access to ECU inputs and outputs, they also provide an in-depth look into the ECU\u2019s memory.\n> \n> [Vector: A Look Behind the Scenes; ECU testing with XCP support](https://cdn.vector.com/cms/content/know-how/_technical-articles/CANoe_AMD_XCP_PressArticle_201812_EN.pdf)\n\nThe testing phase itself is done with CAPL or with CANape as we'll soon see. One extracts the values of variables from a running ECU, maps them through an a2l file, makes them available to one's system and uses them for testing purposes using a different language than the language used to implement the system in the first place. Does that sound simple? No need to stress it, but any bugs or missing features found in this way will need to be fixed by modifying the C code, the language the actual system is implemented in. So back again to the rebuild cycle.\n\nThe a2l files specify the addresses and what goes where, a sort of an API, if you will. But the actual data to be written or read from an ECU is stored in a different format. [ASAM CDF](https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/cdf/wiki/)\n specifies an XML file format for this purpose while the [ASAM MDF](https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/mdf/wiki/)\n a very efficient binary format. As well as the a2l example mentioned above, the ASAM's website [downloads section](https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/cdf/wiki/)\n also has [cdf and mdf file examples](https://www.asam.net/index.php?eID=dumpFile&t=f&f=2132&token=1672c6611f14141ae705140149a9401141821de0)\n.\n\nVector has found clever ways to generate the a2l files, either through [ASAP2 Studio](https://cdn.vector.com/cms/content/products/asap2/ASAP2Tool-Set_Screenshot_EN.png)\n's intuitive interface [among others](https://www.vector.com/at/en/products/application-areas/ecu-calibration/a2l-data-description)\n, but also from source code directly via C code comments. This, of course, needs outside parsers and code generators since C can do nothing with its own code, which in this case is not even code but a predefined way to tag comments similar to what some tools would use to generate documentation. Here is an example from [ASAP2 Tool-Set User Manual](https://cdn.vector.com/cms/content/products/asap2/Docs/ASAP2Tool-Set_Manual_EN.pdf)\n on how to annotate C code with comments for the automatic generation of a2l files at build time (check the manual for more examples),\n\n> /\\*  \n> @@ SYMBOL = sample1  \n> @@ A2L\\_TYPE = MEASURE  \n> @@ DATA\\_TYPE = UBYTE  \n> @@ END  \n> \\*/  \n> \n> results in...\n> \n> /begin MEASUREMENT sample1 \"\"  \n> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0UBYTE NO\\_COMPU\\_METHOD 0 0 0 255  \n> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ECU\\_ADDRESS 0  \n> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/begin IF\\_DATA CANAPE\\_EXT  \n> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0100  \n> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LINK\\_MAP \"sample1\" 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  \n> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/end IF\\_DATA  \n> /end MEASUREMENT\n\nThis rift, this mismatch at the boundary between two systems expressed in different languages, is another recurring theme. It always creates a need to conceive extra formats to patch that gap and make the two understand each other and use each other's data. That's a big problem when tools proliferate due to there not being a powerful one in the first place. It is why our traveler takes ten days for a journey that should take just one. Kings of the old knew that. If everybody does not speak the same language and enjoy the same culture, willingly or forcefully through the kiss of the sword, every journey through the king's land involves talking to every tribesman to secure safe passage. Some ask exorbitant prices, some refuse outright. A dirty business and a bad climate for business.\n\nIt is the same story with prose writing, I find. If English hadn't given me the words and metaphors and the technical means to wrap up things in rifts and kings, I would either have to use another language (and offer the reader a dictionary and a way of translating from one expression to another, similar to what a2l does) or repeat the same things over and over. But as things stand I can wrap up concepts already talked about and understood by the reader in a few words or images and refer to them instead, shifting the discussion to a higher level. Or my language can be visual, like in arts, or theater or music. In that case the medium of transmission is different which is what all these file formats do. Eventually in life one must pass beyond the everyday language of he did this, then he did that to express some different concepts and feelings. Maybe that's the meaning of the well-known saying that Lisp has assisted a number of our most gifted fellow humans in thinking previously impossible thoughts. Additionally, the quest for such metaphors is another technical problem. Similar to iteration speed in programming, I want to quickly find new words, write them down, reread, edit, delete, write again. As fast as possible. I can't imagine what writing without a computer was like in the past.\n\nI've hinted in a previous comment about a tool to handle all this calibration business in one place, a special tool only for this purpose, [CANape](https://www.vector.com/int/en/products/products-a-z/software/canape)\n (CAN Application Programming Environment) or The Universal Tool in the Vehicle, Test Bench and Laboratory (see [CANape: Product Information](https://cdn.vector.com/cms/content/products/canape/Docs/CANape_ProductInformation_EN.pdf)\n).\n\nThe Wikipedia article on [CANape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CANape)\n stresses the part where one does not modify the source code but updates the configuration variables to change an ECUs behavior, which is avoiding the exact rebuild-restart cycle I've underlined already.\n\nAgain, because buttons and clicks help a user only up to a certain point, to make sense of the possibly thousands of data points per second, CANape uses a scripting language. Can you guess it? Is it CAPL? No! It's CASL (Calculation and Scripting Language). Don't stress, though, the syntax of CASL is very similar to the C programming language. The official manual even assures one of only needing a general programming knowledge of C and nothing else,\n\n> Note: Do not confuse CASL with the programming language CAPL, which is used in the CANoe and CANalyzer environments. CAPL is an event-oriented programming language. So-called CAPL program nodes are used to specify when an event will be executed and the nature of the reaction. CASL, on the other hand, is a signal-oriented language.\n> \n> [CANape CASL: User Manual](https://cdn.vector.com/cms/content/products/canape/Docs/CANape_CASL_Manual_EN.pdf)\n\nThe fear of pointers is still with us, plus extra trivialities,\n\n> The CANape scripting language CASL is very similar to the C programming language. However, it differs in the following aspects:\n> \n> *   CANape uses only double values for internal calculations\n> *   CANape does not use pointers\n> *   A missing result type is interpreted as void\n> *   Arrays of any dimension and size may be passed\n> *   An empty parameter list is allowed like in C++\n> *   Overloading of functions (i.e., multiple functions with the same name but with different parameter lists) is possible like in C++\n> *   A parameter check is made like in C++\n> \n> [CANape CASL: User Manual](https://cdn.vector.com/cms/content/products/canape/Docs/CANape_CASL_Manual_EN.pdf)\n\nCASL is still not strong enough. It can be extended through DLLs for case where you might still want to go back and actually [use C functions directly from CASL](https://cdn.vector.com/cms/content/know-how/_application-notes/AN-IMC-1-012_How_to_use_C-Code_Functions_in_CANape.pdf)\n, a language developed to interact with systems developed in C, or I donno, it all starts to get really confusing at this point so I'll leave it to you to explore it further.\n\nA language is not just its syntax but the tools and environment around it\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEmbedded developers are a special kind of software people. They use countless IDEs, probably a legacy of each microprocessor vendor mixing up their own IDE to be sold as opium for all the known software affections. At least in that other fantasy land, the rivalry is between two venerable kings, Emacs and VIM, but here the [holy wars](https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/1e4rbbk/of_ides_and_holy_wars)\n look different, some of them use plain Nodepad, some have advanced to Notepad++, [MPLAB](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/50002027d.pdf)\n, [CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html)\n, [QtCreator](https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator)\n and some to [CodeWarrior](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/IDE_5.9_Users_Guide.pdf)\n, the best kind of warrior for our wannabe emperor. Even the DSLs (yes, let's call them that and stop pretending) like CAPL and CASL and the other programming languages we've seen until now come with their own IDEs.\n\nHere is what GreenHils, one these poison-mixers, is saying\n\n> By using a common set of development tools across projects, software engineers can more easily share code or move between projects without compromising productivity. The Project Builder\u2019s intuitive GUI automates and simplifies the configuration of complex programming projects. With its automatic dependency determination, the Builder also helps cut time-to-market by eliminating the need to write and debug makefiles.\n> \n> [MULTI - Integrated Development Environment for Device Software Optimization](http://flashtech.com.my/PDF/GH-MultiIDE.pdf)\n\nGod forbid the maker and his makefiles. They're too old and well established to keep using them. QtCreator employs [qmake](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qmake-manual.html)\n to help simplify the build process for development projects across different platforms. It automates the generation of makefiles so that only a few lines of information are needed to create each makefile. The MULTI IDE uses a proprietary, xml-based, configuration file ([gpj](https://amazingalgorithms.com/file-extensions/gpj)\n) instead of makefiles but it also generates makefiles behind our backs. The switch to other tools to edit configuration options now becomes a near impossibility, as now everything that can be configured must be configured through that vendor's random interface, buttons and menus, a new interface from the ones already familiar to you, an interface bound to change. Some IDEs even have different config files that are incompatible from one version to the next,\n\n> \\[...\\] my main complaint with other tools is proprietary config file formats which leave me stuck using their low-effort interface for absolutely every change before compiling. If I can't use my favorite text-based tool to diff/compare and make meaningful configuration changes, I will curse every extra click or scroll that I'm forced to perform in their proprietary software just to change an option for which I already know the name.\n> \n> [A reddit user](https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/1cgsgbw/how_to_improve_autosar_stack/)\n\nAs an example of how complicated and how non-standard such a setup can become, see the official Getting Started with [Green Hills Tools](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/supporting-information/DWF13_AMF_AUT_T1059.pdf)\n guide from Renesas, a semiconductor manufacturer, as there is no freely available online documentation or tutorial from GreenHills itself on how all this works.\n\nSpeaking of Renesas, they proudly boast their own accomplishments in the IDE's field,\n\n> CS+ is an IDE integrating the necessary tools for the development phase of software (e.g. design, implementation, and debugging) into a single platform. By providing an integrated environment, it is possible to perform all development using just this product, without the need to use many different tools separately.\n> \n> [CS+ V8.05.00 Integrated Development Environment: User\u2019s Manual](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/document/man/cs-v80500-integrated-development-environment-users-manual-ghs-ccrh850-build-tool-operation)\n\nBut Renesas goes one step further into unexplored territory. They have four different IDEs in their shop and even different, incompatible proprietary config file formats at that! Even inside the same company it proves quite impossible to decide on a single file format. There is ample documentation on [how to migrate between IDEs](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/software-tool/migration-tools-ide)\n (or [here](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/document/mat/project-conversion-between-e-studio-and-cs-notes-and-tips)\n) and even from their IDEs to GreenHills. That's just a hint on how complicated even the business of writing code in a text editor can become.\n\nRules and processes are enforced with non-formal methods\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nEven in a [dead language like C](https://mihaiolteanu.me/language-abstractions)\n that offers no means to create incomprehensible DSLs and rich abstractions one can still bring to life ugly monsters,\n\n> While C programs can be laid out in a structured and comprehensible manner, C makes it easy for programmers to write obscure code that is difficult to understand.\n> \n> There are areas of the language that are commonly misunderstood by programmers. For example, C has more operators than some other languages and consequently has a high number of different operator precedence levels, some of which are not intuitive. The type rules provided by C can also be confusing to programmers who are familiar with strongly-typed languages. For example, operands may be promoted to wider types, meaning that the type resulting from an operation is not necessarily the same as that of the operands.\n> \n> C programs can be compiled into small and efficient machine code, but the trade-off is that there is a very limited degree of run-time checking. C programs generally do not provide run-time checking for common problems such as arithmetic exceptions (e.g. divide by zero), overflow, validity of pointers, or array bound errors. The C philosophy is that the programmer is responsible for making such checks explicitly.\n> \n> [MISRA C:2012 Guidelines for the use of the C language in critical systems](https://github.com/sakura1083841400/MISRA-C/blob/main/MISRA%20C%202012%20Guidelines%20for%20the%20use%20of.pdf)\n\nThe solution in automotive is to define standards that enforce certain coding practices, ban features like multiple returns from a single function, ban recursive functions or the dynamic allocation of memory (malloc) at runtime. But since one needs global constants to at least keep ECU configuration options (see Calibration, for example), this last rule forces a static pre-allocation of all memory at build-time. The usual approach is to keep tables with variable names, addresses and memory sizes in excel sheets, but since excel sheets are outside of C syntax, guess what do we need to bring in again? Code generators! I won't dwelve on this issues again as it's already familiar from the dbc files discussion.\n\nThe somewhat good news is that some of MISRA rules can be enforced with static checkers. These can generate reports about what rules are followed and what not, similar to a compiler. That bad news is that some rules can only be checked by manual inspection alone so you put your faith in the good will and patience of the developer,\n\n> It is possible to check that C source code complies with MISRA C by means of inspection alone. However, this is likely to be extremely time-consuming and error prone. Any realistic process for checking code against MISRA C will therefore involve the use of at least one static analysis tool.\n> \n> All of the factors that apply to compiler selection apply also to the selection of static analysis tools, although the validation of analysis tools is a little different from that of compilers. An ideal static analysis tool would:\n> \n> *   Detect all violations of MISRA C guidelines;\n> *   Produce no false positives, i.e. would only report genuine violations and would not report non-violations or possible violations.\n> \n> It is not, and never will be, possible to produce a static analysis tool that meets this ideal behavior. The ability to detect the maximum number of violations possible, while minimizing the number of false positive messages, is therefore an important factor in choosing a tool.\n> \n> There is a wide range of tools available with execution times ranging from seconds to days. Broadly speaking, tools that consume less time are more likely to produce false positives than those that consume large amounts of time. Consideration should also be given to the balance between analysis time and analysis precision during tool selection.\n> \n> Analysis tools vary in their emphasis. Some might be general purpose, whereas others might focus on performing a thorough analysis of a subset of potential issues. Thus it might be necessary to use more than one tool in order to maximize the coverage of issues.\n> \n> Each mandatory, required and advisory rule is classified as decidable or undecidable. This classification describes the theoretical ability of a static analyzer to answer the question \u201cDoes this code comply with this rule?\u201d The directives are not classified in this way because it is impossible, given only the source code, to devise an algorithm that could guarantee to check for compliance.\n> \n> [MISRA C:2012 Guidelines for the use of the C language in critical systems](https://github.com/sakura1083841400/MISRA-C/blob/main/MISRA%20C%202012%20Guidelines%20for%20the%20use%20of.pdf)\n\nOne feature, or a limitation, is that the committee admits not all use-cases can be foreseen by the standard so it offers a deviation feature. A deviation is another non-formal piece of text saying this or that rule can be skipped in this or that circumstance: It is important that such deviations are properly recorded and authorized. Individual programmers can be prevented from deviating guidelines by means of a formal authorization procedure. Formal record keeping is good practice and supports any safety argument that might be made for the software.\n\nSo MISRA rules save some headaches and errors when applied, but there are places where they don't apply and that is necessary for the project and good. After a while you kinda start [ignoring MISRA](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38182855)\n with we need this here anyway, MISRA doesn't know what is doing, I'll just check this in and be merry. It is a standard that employs extra tooling for it to be enforced and generates additional documents, be them Word documents or code comments, or what have you.\n\nI don't think this is truly realized, but all this information written down in word sheets, requirements, knowledge passed on in meetings, little tricks and short hacks solved in video calls, information passed in emails and instant messaging is information that is part of the project, that is put down in some kind of a language, a non-formal one like English or tables or boxes or scribbles or laughs and jokes. The more a project has of these, the harder it is to talk about and verify the actual state of the project as it is obviously impossible to evaluate a non-formal language like you would a formal programming language and thus it becomes that much harder to explore and play with, test and explore the project.\n\nDomain specific languages are everywhere\n----------------------------------------\n\nSome colleagues openly admitted of not knowing C at all, even though their CVs and their positions assumed such knowledge. But how? They've developed visual models in [Simulink](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html)\n, a block diagram environment used to design systems with multi domain models, simulate before moving to hardware, and deploy without writing code. Unlike the CANoe ECU models that are meant to aid in the understanding of the project but need a software developer to write the ECU code, this graphical programming language also generates the C code, efficient and MISRA compliant at that. See the [Automotive Code Generation](https://www.mathworks.com/solutions/embedded-code-generation/production-code-automotive-ecu.html)\n page for details. C is here treated as a kind of a bytecode, never to be seen, never to be touched. Now don't go buzzing me with we don't need nor like DSLs here silly story. I won't believe you anymore. I can't!\n\nThe graphical programming language, similar to [LabVIEW](https://www.ni.com/en/shop/labview.html)\n if you're more familiar with that, is used to move blocks around and connect them to pass the data and the computational results from one block to another, as one would call functions and return their values in a classic text-based programming language. Behind each block is [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/programming-with-matlab.html)\n, a high-level programming language designed for engineers and scientists that expresses matrix and array mathematics directly. Some user success stories for warm-up follow,\n\n> Simulink is particularly helpful in two stages of our development process. Early on, it helps us try new ideas and visualize how they will work. After generating code and conducting in-vehicle tests, we can run multiple simulations, refine the design, and regenerate code for the next iteration.\n> \n> [Jonny Andersson, Scania](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html)\n\n> Whether you\u2019re developing controls for \\[...\\] an autonomous vehicle, an excavator, \\[...\\], if your team is manually writing code and using document-based requirements capture, the only way to answer these questions will be through trial and error or testing on a physical prototype. And if a single requirement changes, the entire system will have to be recorded and rebuilt, delaying the project by days, or even weeks.\n> \n> Using Model-Based Design with MATLAB\u00ae and Simulink\u00ae, instead of handwritten code and documents, you create a system model \\[...\\]. You can simulate the model at any point to get an instant view of system behavior and to test out multiple what-if scenarios without risk, without delay, and without reliance on costly hardware.\n> \n> [Model-Based Design for Embedded Control Systems](https://www.mathworks.com/content/dam/mathworks/white-paper/gated/model-based-design-with-simulation-white-paper.pdf)\n\nExactly the issue I've touched upon in the introduction. C's abstractions are not powerful enough to rise above dumb low-level details and get a clear picture of what you're trying to achieve, talk about that, share those bigger ideas with colleagues and refine on them. It also touches on that other point, namely, the iteration speed, how fast can you go from one version to the next, how fast can you change the implementation, test it, rewrite it, change your assumptions, see something tangible and not just imagining things and talking about things in meetings and on informal communication channels, be them video or texting.\n\nBut, my apologies for the interruption, I'll let these people talk for themselves, since they touch on all the pain points so beautifully,\n\n> In a traditional workflow, where requirements are captured in documents, hand off can lead to errors and delay. Often, the engineers creating the design documents or requirements are different from those who design the system. Requirements may be \u201cthrown over a wall,\u201d meaning there\u2019s no clear or consistent communication between the two teams.\n> \n> In Model-Based Design, you author, analyze, and manage requirements within your Simulink model. You can create rich text requirements with custom attributes and link them to designs, code, and tests. Requirements can also be imported and synchronized from external sources such as requirements management tools. When a requirement linked to the design changes, you receive automatic notification. As a result, you can identify the part of the design or test directly affected by the change and take appropriate action to address it.\n> \n> In a traditional workflow, embedded code must be handwritten from system models or from scratch. Software engineers write control algorithms based on specifications written by control systems engineers. Each step in this process\u2014writing the specification, manually coding the algorithms, and debugging the handwritten code can be both time-consuming and error-prone. With Model-Based Design, instead of writing thousands of lines of code by hand, you generate code directly from your model, and the model acts as a bridge between the software engineers and the control systems engineers. The generated code can be used for rapid prototyping or production. Rapid prototyping provides a fast and inexpensive way to test algorithms on hardware in real time and perform design iterations in minutes rather than weeks. You can use prototype hardware or your production ECU. With the same rapid prototyping hardware and design models, you can conduct hardware-in-the-loop testing and other test and verification activities to validate hardware and software designs before production. Production code generation converts your model into the actual code that will be implemented on the production embedded system. The generated code can be optimized for specific processor architectures and integrated with handwritten legacy code.\n> \n> [Model-Based Design for Embedded Control Systems](https://www.mathworks.com/content/dam/mathworks/white-paper/gated/model-based-design-with-simulation-white-paper.pdf)\n\nCheck out an example of generating C code from a Simulink model with the [Simulink Coder](https://www.mathworks.com/help/rtw/ug/generating-code-using-simulink-coder.html)\n. Since the generated code must fit in with the rest of the project, sometimes adjustments are necessary, like in this example on how to [configure the model](https://www.mathworks.com/help/rtw/ug/configure-model-data-for-c-code-generation.html)\n for C code generation.\n\nNeedless to say, this is a whole new and complex language, we don't need no special new languages besides C, we need only if's, else's and everything as concrete as possible people be damned. No wonder engineers working with Simulink are not necessarily C developers. Simulink is a brand new universe that takes years to swim safely through its waters, regardless of what the marketing white paper above says about it being easy to use and avoiding the time-consuming and error-prone method of hand-writing your own code. HAND-WRITING YOUR CODE?! That's an activity for future to be software anarchists! Regardless, the suits of the present seem to have developed a fondness towards it and for code that generates code. Code that generates code?! Wait, I've heard that idea before and it usually gets smashed to pieces as being irrelevant for us here. Regardless, I'll pass the microphone again,\n\n> Compact, efficient code: the code automatically generated with Embedded Coder and Simulink Coder required about 16% less RAM than the handwritten code used on a previous version of the Cruise Controller; the code met all project requirements for efficiency and structure.\n> \n> High test efficiency: debugging the control software on the desktop instead of in the vehicle enabled the Daimler team to reduce the time and cost associated with resolving software problems.\n> \n> Fast development: the entire project, including analysis, restructuring, modeling, and testing, took just 18 months.

In model-based development, you construct an executable specification \u2013 the model \u2013 of your system and establish its properties through simulation and testing in early stages of development.

It is too easy for errors to creep into the code that can be extremely difficult to find. Problems start with the syntax because it makes writing code vulnerable to error. For example, optional braces, assignment in expressions, and automatic switch/case fall through, etc. Then there are semantically dubious or complex features that are difficult to use correctly and encourage \u201cprogramming on the edge of safety.\u201c For example, goto statements, pointers, and integral promotion. These aspects can also interact in dangerous ways\n> \n> ETAS is rising to all these challenges with a new language to engineer safe and secure software effectively: Embedded Software Development Language (ESDL). ESDL eliminates typical C pitfalls and, in addition, enables software reuse, simplifies maintenance, and supports product-line variant engineering.

It is interesting to note that the model and the code are seen as different entities. In Lisp world, the model that generates the Lisp code is still Lisp. That's the big difference. In automotive world, the model that generates C code is something entirely different. It could be a visual language, it could make use of xml files, it can implement a scripting language. All these combined define the modeling language.\n\nSure it is easy to fall prey to such hype and most of is maybe just that, hype and marketing and people wanting to make money and gain market share.

The ideal is to buy everything from suppliers who also take on the liability in case there are bugs and recalls need to be made. If you work with Autosar, you need to be VERY clear with your future employer about what EXACTLY your duties will be. It is very likely that your role as an Autosar developer will mainly consist of integrating Autosar components and configuring them.\n> \n> Lol, you are joking right? Any person who values their time and career future and wants to actually develop something fun would stay away from AUTOSAR.\n> \n> I like cars and tried the Autosar route. It kind of sucked the fun out of development for me.\n> \n> [Reddit answers to a user asking if they should go with Autosar in their career](https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/zdb02b/to_autosar_or_not_to_autosar/)\n\n[Autosar](https://www.autosar.org/)\n's goal is to aid in [code reuse](https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/standards/R21-11/CP/AUTOSAR_TPS_SoftwareComponentTemplate.pdf)\n through standard modules and interfaces. The modules are implemented and sold by third-party vendors, either independently or as a [whole stack](https://www.vector.com/int/en/products/products-a-z/embedded-software/microsar/)\n while their configuration and the connection between them (the function calls, after all) are done through visual tools and code generators.\n\nThere are two main Autosar schools of thought, the [Classic Platform](https://www.autosar.org/standards/classic-platform)\n where the ECU's software is split into three layers, the [Layered Software Architecture](https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/standards/R22-11/CP/AUTOSAR_EXP_LayeredSoftwareArchitecture.pdf)\n document having all the details and the pretty pictures and the [Adaptive Platform](https://www.autosar.org/standards/adaptive-platform)\n which implements the AUTOSAR Runtime for Adaptive Applications (ARA). Two types of interfaces are available, services and APIs. The platform consists of functional clusters which are grouped in services and the AUTOSAR Adaptive Basis. Yes, I really don't know what that means or why they are called platforms.\n\nThe reason for this split, aside from the increased complexity and high-performance computing needs mentioned in the [Explanation of Adaptive Platform Software Architecture](https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/standards/R21-11/AP/AUTOSAR_EXP_SWArchitecture.pdf)\n and a really surprise move on the part of the more than 350 Autosar [Autosar legislators](https://www.autosar.org/about/partners)\n, is that these platforms are specifically [targeting C and C++](https://www.mathworks.com/help/autosar/ug/autosar-platform-comparison.html)\n. Autosar is not language-agnostic though it boasts itself as [a rich and modern programming environment](https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/standards/R20-11/AP/AUTOSAR_RS_General.pdf)\n . As such, the standard is quite low-level, it does specify the details of what goes where but does not build new abstractions to make it easy to talk about the project. It does build visual tools instead, as we shall see. A change to a different programming language, like Rust, would again force the change to a still new standard, as the change from C to C++ did, if that future ever comes before Autosar anarchists storm the castle and burn it to the ground,\n\n> If you want a dead end career, autosar is a good place to start. I could barely sustain for a month working with that messed up software.\n> \n> [Reddit: comment to the question Is automotive embedded Autosar only?](https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/198iurj/is_automotive_embedded_autosar_only/)\n\nIt also brings it new types that have to be mapped back to C++, similar to a2l. Remember the dictionaries and the transport medium across that rift? Either way, the gist is that modules developed by one vendor, if it follows the correct Autosar platform and platform version can be used like lego bricks. Pluck them into a project using the same Autosar platform and version alongside other modules developed by the same or even a different vendor and it should all work, it's interfaces will have the structure and semantics defined by Autosar. Hardly groundbreaking! Though it needs over [2300 official documents](https://www.autosar.org/search)\n spanning more than [13000 pages](https://www.ar-compendium.com)\n to specify in the minutest of details the architecture of the entire software stack of the ECU itself, what goes into each module, what goes out, the types of data, the function signatures, all that.\n\n> The AUTOSAR application communication interface shall allow AUTOSAR applications to use the same interface definition independently of whether they are located on the same or on different ECUs. A standardized interface definition for applications is a prerequisite for the reuse of software and hardware independent deployment.\n> \n> [Autosar: Main Requirements](https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/standards/R22-11/FO/AUTOSAR_RS_Main.pdf)\n\nThings are a bit messy when it comes to file formats. Unlike the safe lands we've seen before, the XML file is again the choice for such module specification, though it also requires UML diagrams, excel files, GUI tools and splashy visuals,\n\n> In a development process, many different tools with different representation of AUTOSAR models are used (Excel Sheets, Modeling Tools, UML, XML, etc.). Each tool and its underlying representation of data have their advantages and disadvantages. These tools and representations can be grouped into technological spaces.\n> \n> Using XML and UML within AUTOSAR combines the strength of both technological spaces: AUTOSAR defined templates for data that is exchanged in AUTOSAR. Since XML is widely accepted as a standard for representation and exchange of structured data it was chosen to be the basis for the exchange of AUTOSAR models. Due to the complexity of the data and its interrelationships a manual creation of a consistent AUTOSAR XML schema turned out to be time-consuming and error prone. In addition the expressive power of XML schema is not sufficient for expressing content related constraints between data entities.\n> \n> Therefore a meta-model based approach was chosen to graphically describe the templates by means of UML2.0 class diagrams. Constraints that cannot be formulated graphically are described textually in the template specifications respectively as OCL (Object constraint language). The UML model which defines all data entities and interrelationships that can be used for describing AUTOSAR systems and related artifacts is called AUTOSAR meta-model. An instance of the meta-model, i.e. a concrete description of software components, etc., is called an AUTOSAR model.\n\nAutosar here even mentions the reason behind needing a new format: [commonly readable](https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/standards/R22-11/CP/AUTOSAR_EXP_AIUserGuide.pdf)\n by both parties across the rift. Commonly readable again, not human readable. Here are some arxml examples: [PortInterfaces.arxml](https://github.com/telehan/autosar-arxml/blob/master/examples/autosar3/portinterfaces/PortInterfaces.arxml)\n and [EcuM\\_swc.arxml](https://github.com/nikidimitrow/Learning-AUTOSAR-fundamental/blob/master/BasicsOfAUTOSAR/EcuM_swc.arxml)\n.\n\nIf in CANoe one would bring in help to model a single ECU, in Autosar one models the entire car by way of these Components which then get assigned to either the same ECU or different ECUs connected to the same CAN network, for example. This is somewhat similar to what Kubernetes would do when you want another instance of your Docker app up and running without having to worry where it will be deployed.\n\nAutosar comes with its own terminology (runnables, software components, PDUs, Ports, splittables, etc; check the 140 pages long [glossary](https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/standards/R22-11/FO/AUTOSAR_TR_Glossary.pdf)\n for more). The UML diagrams even have their own original icons (see [Autosar: Virtual Functional Bus, Chapter 3: Overall mechanisms and concepts](https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/standards/R20-11/CP/AUTOSAR_EXP_VFB.pdf)\n).\n\nGUI tooling **is** the way to develop software with Autosar, from configuring, splitting, merging, modifying the arxml files to generating the C or C++ code. There are some old friends in this space, with [Vector](https://cdn.vector.com/cms/content/know-how/autosar/Documents/AUTOSAR_Solution_Fact_Sheet_EN.pdf)\n offering a complete solution for your projects: tools, basic software, engineering services, on-site support and training classes.

While kings dream of impossibly expensive grand palaces the soldiers in the field know about how crazy all this is, they feel and see that they've become button clickers instead of software engineers. But I'll let others share their pain and misery of having to live with a DSL not invented by one person but by an association of over 350 automotive partners worldwide,\n\n> If you want to increase the chances of being miserable in your professional career start working with autosar. I worked 3 months with it, and just bailed, I spend more time dealing with the tooling than actually implementing a feature.\n> \n> The only way I learned any of that was to screw around with it and very deliberately ask questions when updates were made so that I could learn. By the end of it, I was able to make simple changes but honestly I still never understood what was going on behind the scenes. If you get good at it, it\u2019s decent job security. But it\u2019s gonna be quite a ride.\n> \n> What you do do all day long is use Autosar GUIs. For those, no public tutorials exist as far as I'm aware because not only do these tools cost serious money, the seminars taught on how to use them aren't free either. This exactly is why you can't meaningfully learn Autosar without having an Autosar-related job. You just don't have access to the tools and 3rd party libraries.\n> \n> [Users feelings on Reddit about their own experience with Autosar](https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/167clxg/how_to_learn_autosar/)\n\n> AUTOSAR takes a long time to get a hold of. I got 1.5 years in it and I still haven't understood that thing properly. You can spend 10 years working on just Com stack or diag stack that would still be about 15-20% of autosar architecture. In fact you can spend your entire career with just that one stack. I know folks who have worked 5 years in one stack and struggle when they change over to a new stack. It's a painful software to deal with, at least on the vector daVinci software, you make one drop-down menu selection and your configuration in 2 other places would have been changed. The documentation for the architecture is published on the autosar website and it's free to read. The software is a whole other story. You can't buy the software because it's really expensive. You can't pirate download the software because the automobile companies usually send a list of features needed and the companies like vector which provide the software just release the software with the requested features for that specific project. You gotta have to bang your head a lot and struggle for a few initially to get a hold of the thing.\n> \n> Basically a tool that is supposed to make a bunch of automotive makers happy but in reality it leaves everyone equally unhappy, but because it is standardized it gets used anyway.\n> \n> I actually LOVE automotive. But I would never touch any AUTOSAR project. AUTOSAR is basically just a convoluted way to deflect blame (and liability) when some weird software bugs happen. I would go as far as saying that AUTOSAR makes software quality worse, because nobody understands how this complex monster of XML, headers, configs, #ifdevs etc works. I prefer to spend my time to write solid architecture, easy understandable code, and test the shit out of my code. Complexity is the enemy of quality.\n> \n> Now I just sit back with a margarita in my hand and enjoy watching the European car brands being out-innovated by more nimble, flexible, maintainable, adaptable, robust, fitter Asian brands. Once the last German automotive supplier is gone kaputt, AUTOSAR will be forgotten by history. Darwin always wins in the end....\n> \n> Autosar is bad. It is bad as specification(nonono it is not a standard, it is a specification) for multiple reason. But that is not actually a problem. The problem is implementations. They are horrible, they are bad at any angle. Buggy tooling, ignoring actual autosar(they call it a deviation), slow, incompatible, ugly implemented bsp level, where you have to learn tens and hundreds of workarounds and tricks. Simplest operation takes weeks to implement.\n> \n> It is the ecosystem around the autosar that is cancerous. The tools are buggy and atrocious. The code they produce is unreadable and in some instances buggy as well. The documentation is also non-existent. The complexity is bigger than developing by hand but I guess you gain the time of testing and complying with all the standards. And all these at a very high price point. The few months I worked with some of these tools were the most miserable months of my career. If you work above mcal you are not an embedded developer you are a systems engineer. Where I work the people that have only worked on automotive lack very fundamental knowledge of embedded. I wonder what will happen in the automotive industry when there will be very few that grasp the low level.\n> \n> Vector daVinci is really a pain in the ... . The documentation is somehow vague , they do not offer too many details. And i found a lot of bugs in the cbd package that i received from them after being bought for more than a couple thousands. On the other hand , i had a project in which i had to rewrite manually the CanNm stack (non autosar project which used autosar type NM) and still has problems. The idea of standardization is not bad by itself, only the complexity of configuring correctly the project is driving me nuts.\n> \n> [Reddit: Hate for Autosar](https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/1cef2ql/hate_for_autosar/)\n\nThe future: self-driving cars go all in on DSLs\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThe wannabes Caesars have done it. They won't leave any stone unturned, not a single place on the continent remains untouched by their grandiosity. And as such, they have legislated new languages with which now one speaks of the driving conditions and of the interactions between cars, though I don't see what new things they introduce besides the human-readable Python-like syntax, that provides for a lower learning curve for domain experts while supporting a domain model that is directly recognizable by domain experts ( [ASAM introduction](https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_DSL/latest/language-reference/introduction.html#_domain_specific_language)\n) and a need to describe the behavior of the autonomous vehicle as well as other actors or entities in the environment.\n\nThis standard started out as an xml-based format but evolved into a full-fleged DSL, the [ASAM OpenSCENARIO](https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_DSL/latest/introduction.html)\n, which defines a declarative, constraint-based and aspect-oriented programming language.

Every imaginable torture has been inflicted upon it. Its use restricted, features forbidden, fresh blood brought in to replace its inadequacies, people banned for even seeing its face, its true self painted over with colorful interfaces. Nobody wants to see its true image, nobody to hear its voice. Yet, they say it is the thing they all need. Like health, they all praise it then drink themselves to death. A plethora of tools to increase the speed of development, to inspect a running system, to exchange requirements and reach agreement between teams and stakeholders as to what needs to be developed and extra programming languages have taken its place.\n\nIf Lisp gives its practitioners the freedom to dream and play with their own wild abstractions, its absence gives companies the opportunity to flood the market with junk-food software and keep developers hooked on these cheap, calorie intensive but nutritionally void substitutes. And build fortunes, as a result.\n\nOn the other hand, I feel skeptical that one tool can solve all problems. I feel skeptical that Lisp can be used everywhere. That fact that it works so well in a couple of instances, like it does for Emacs or [StumpWM](https://stumpwm.github.io/)\n among others, is no real argument. The cost, the energy, the developers' know-how, must all be counted in as well. There is only so much talent lying around in any industry. [Not everybody can live in designer houses](https://mihaiolteanu.me/if-lisp-is-so-great)\n, some must live in cramped apartment blocks. It is possible that the software industry has stretched itself thin, most probably driven by profits. Software is the promised land where investors multiply their fortunes. When more and more of these gold-seekers pour in, the human resources needs increase as well. At one point there is a lack of sufficiently trained or naturally inclined practitioners to be able to do the job. So naturally the response is to lower the entry threshold. Naturally the response is to simplify, improve and expand on the tools these newcomers use. The more intuitive, the better. With the negative effects we see all around us. It is possible indeed that a small team of knowledgeable parentheses masters could build a car's software in Lisp, do it better and more efficiently than what is now available in the industry with all these tools we've seen. But add in dozens of car companies in the mix all wanting a market share in this gold rush and the number of available teams riding wild horses and still being able to [take a shot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthian_shot)\n decreases dramatically. So what is one supposed to do? Bring in the tamed horses. The old ones, too. Even the lame ones! In times of war, even donkeys are good enough and can count as horses for a while.\n\n-----\nGenerate comments in a hierarchical structure with 3 comments per level, up to a depth of 3."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n- **VyseofArcadia** (): I was a bit baffled the first time I was introduced to Simulink Coder. I get the value proposition: simulate your model so that you have confidence it&#x27;s doing the right thing, and then essentially just run that model as code instead of implementing it yourself and possibly introducing mistakes. What I didn&#x27;t understand, as a software guy, not an engineering guy, was why on earth you&#x27;d want a <i>graphical</i> programming language to do that. Surely it would be easier to just write your model in a traditional text-based language. Hell, the same company even makes their own language (MATLAB) that would be perfect for the task.<p>I did a little digging, and it turns out I had it backwards. It&#x27;s not that Simulink invented a new graphical programming language to do this stuff. Control systems engineers have been studying and documenting systems using Simulink-style block diagrams since at least the 1960s. Simulink just took something that used to be a paper and chalkboard modeling tool and made it executable on a computer.\n  - **buescher** (): Bingo.  Additionally, control theory block diagrams are pretty rigorous, with algebraic rules for manipulating them you&#x27;ll find in a controls textbook.  You can pretty much enter a block diagram from Apollo documentation into Simulink and &quot;run&quot; it, in much the same way you could run a spice simulation on a schematic from that era.\n    - **tonyarkles** (): Yeah, there&#x27;s a really interesting phenomenon that I&#x27;ve observed that goes with that. If what you&#x27;re describing was the main way people used it, I&#x27;d be very satisfied with that and have actually been chewing on ways to potentially bring those kinds of concepts into the more &quot;mainstream&quot; programming world (I&#x27;m not going to go way off on that tangent right now)<p>What I&#x27;ve seen many times though in my career that awkwardly spans EE and CS is that people forget that you can still... write equations instead of doing everything in Simulink. As an example I was looking at a simplified model of an aircraft a couple months ago.<p>One of the things it needed to compute was the density of air at a given altitude. This is a somewhat complicated equation that is a function of altitude, temperature (which can be modelled as a function of altitude), and some other stuff. These are, despite being a bit complicated, straightforward equations. The person who had made this model didn&#x27;t write the equations, though, they instead made a Simulink sub-model for it with a bunch of addition, multiplication, and division blocks in a ratsnest.<p>I think the Simulink approach should be used when it brings clarity to the problem, and should be abandoned when it obscures the problem. In this case it took a ton of mental energy to reassemble all of the blocks back into a simple closed-form equation and then further re-arranging to verify that it matched the textbook equation.\n  - **jocaal** (): The people using matlab are typically experts in things other than programming. Matlab is for people designing antennas or control systems, where the math is more important than the code.\n    - **VyseofArcadia** (): Most definitely, but my point was to my programmer-brain, nearly any text-based modeling language would be better than some sort of awkward graphical diagram. And since the same company makes MATLAB, why not?<p>It turns out non-programmers actually like graphical tools. Go figure.\n    - **molteanu** (): Well, software developers in the embedded field of automotive use Matlab and Simulink quite extensively. I haven&#x27;t worked with it myself but the &quot;excuse&quot; for using it was that &quot;we have complicated state machines that would be difficult to write directly in C&quot;.\n  - **duped** (): &gt;  Control systems engineers have been studying and documenting systems using Simulink-style block diagrams since at least the 1960s.<p>It dates to at least the 1940s with signal flow graphs (1) but from what I&#x27;ve heard, Shannon was working on fire control systems for the Navy and his work was classified. Some of that was famously published in <i>A Mathematical Theory of Communication</i> (2) where there are block diagrams for information systems, and Mason worked out Mason&#x27;s Gain Rule&#x2F;Formula in the early 1950s.<p>I would not be surprised if graphical representations date back to the 1920s&#x2F;30s when abstracting electrical systems into things like circuit diagrams that ignore grounding were pretty common, or even earlier.<p>(1) <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Signal-flow_graph\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Signal-flow_graph</a>\n- **pfdietz** (): Without Lisp-like macros, you need preprocessors or code generators.  Something like Yacc&#x2F;Bison is easily done with suitable macros.<p>In Common Lisp, macros also enable a kind of Aspect Oriented Programming.  That&#x27;s because one can dynamically modify macro expansion using the macroexpand hook.  It&#x27;s a way to modify a code base without changing the source files, which has all sorts of uses.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;clhs.lisp.se&#x2F;Body&#x2F;v_mexp_h.htm#STmacroexpand-hookST\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;clhs.lisp.se&#x2F;Body&#x2F;v_mexp_h.htm#STmacroexpand-hookST</a><p>One can implement things natively in Common Lisp, like code coverage tools, that require separate tooling in other languages.\n  - **jstanley** (): &gt; It&#x27;s a way to modify a code base without changing the source files<p>Is another way of saying your source files might not do what they say! You&#x27;re not selling it to me.\n    - **praptak** (): &gt; your source files might not do what they say!<p>The disconnect between what your source file &quot;does&quot; and what it &quot;says&quot; is present in everything above assembly.<p>Change implementation of `foo(...)` and suddenly dozens of source files (none of which is modified!) which make calls like `foo(x)`, `foo(y)` and `foo(y+1)` change what they &quot;do&quot;, all this without changing a single line in these files.\n    - **mst** (): Wrapping the existing code in hooks of some sort to enable injecting profiling or whatever is really quite nice.<p>A lot of javascript hot reloading implementations rely on using Babel to do that as part of a build step so they output the wrapped code and your app loads that instead (and it&#x27;s not that dissimilar to compilers having a debug mode where they output very different code).<p>I would certainly side-eye you for using the relevant common lisp hooks in production without a very convincing reason, but for many development time tasks it&#x27;s basically the civilised version of widely used techniques.\n    - **pfdietz** (): A use case is code coverage: you can instrument your code by compiling it in a dynamic environment where the hook causes extra coverage recording code to be inserted.  You&#x27;d like to be able to do this without changing the source code itself.\n  - **EdwardCoffin** (): Gregor Kiczales, the guy behind Aspect Oriented Programming, said something like  Common Lisp couldn&#x27;t attain the level of (aspect oriented) tooling that Java could, because the tools in Common Lisp could not be sure what the Lisp code they were analyzing actually does, but in Java the language is constrained enough that the tools can figure it out.  He said this in a MOP retrospective he gave at the Vancouver Lisp User&#x27;s Group meeting on 28 June 2006 [1].  There&#x27;s a link to an .ogg file in the link below, and he talks about this at around the 45 minute mark.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20060821003818&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bc.tech.coop&#x2F;blog&#x2F;060709.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20060821003818&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bc.tech.co...</a>\n    - **kazinator** (): &gt; <i>but in Java the language is constrained enough that the tools can figure it out</i><p>So, ironically, the AOP tooling both takes advantage of this issue <i>and</i> fixes it in the same stroke. Once you have an AOP-endowed language like AspectJ, tooling can no longer know what code does\n  - **kazinator** (): &gt; <i>one can dynamically modify macro expansion using the macroexpand hook</i><p>That&#x27;s an incredibly bad idea, and it&#x27;s not dynamic except in purely interpreted Lisps that expand the same piece of code each time it is executed.<p>The hooks is absolutely global; whatever you put in there must not break anything.<p>From the spec itself: &quot;For this reason, it is frequently best to confine its uses to debugging situations.&quot;\n    - **pfdietz** (): One would bind the macroexpand hook variable around the call to COMPILE or COMPILE-FILE for that code.  The binding goes away after that.  It wouldn&#x27;t be global at all.\n- **roenxi** (): In my experience (Clojure) macro-heavy libraries tend to be powerful but brittle. A lisp programmer can do things in a library that non-lisp programmers can&#x27;t realistically attempt (Typed Clojure, for example). But the trade offs are very real though hard to put a finger on.<p>There are several Clojure libraries that are cool and completely reliant on macros to be implemented. Eventually, good Clojure programmers seem to stop using them because the trade-offs are worse error messages or uncomfortable edge-case behaviours. The base language is just so good that it doesn&#x27;t really matter, but I&#x27;ve had several experiences where the theoretically-great library had to be abandoned because of how it interacts with debugging tools and techniques.<p>It isn&#x27;t the macros fault, they just hint that a programmer is about to do something that, when it fails, fails in a way that is designed in to the system and can&#x27;t be easily worked around. Macros are basically for creating new syntax constructs - great but when the syntax has bugs, the programmer has a problem. And the community tooling probably won&#x27;t understand it.\n  - **gus_massa** (): In racket you can define simple macros with define-syntax-rule but in case of an error you get a horrible ininteligible message that shows part of the expanded code.<p>But the recomendation is tp use syntax-parse that is almost a DSL to write macros, for example you can specify that a part is an identifier like x instead of an arbitrary expresssion like (+ x 1). It takes more time to use syntax-parse, but when someone uses the macro they get a nice error at the expansion time.<p>(And syntax-parse is implemented in racket using functions and macros. A big part of the racket features are implemented in racket itself.)\n  - **zelphirkalt** (): &gt; Eventually, good Clojure programmers seem to stop using them because the trade-offs are worse error messages or uncomfortable edge-case behaviours.<p>I am not so familiar with Clojure, but I am familiar with Scheme. The thing is not, that a good programmer stops using macros completely, but that a good programmer knows, when they have to reach for a macro, in order to make something syntactically nicer. I&#x27;ve done a few examples:<p>pipeline&#x2F;threading macro: It needs to be a macro in order to avoid having to write (lambda ...) all the time.<p>inventing new define forms: To define things on the module or top level without needed set! or similar. I used this to make a (define-route ...) for communicating with the docker engine. define-route would define a procedure whose name depends on for which route it is.<p>writing a timing macro: This makes for the cleanest syntax, that does not have anything but (time expr1 expr2 expr3 ...).<p>Perhaps the last example is the least necessary.<p>Many things can be solved by using higher-order functions instead.\n    - **hellcow** (): My canonical use-case for macros in Scheme is writing unit tests. If you want to see the unevaluated expression that caused the test failure, you&#x27;ll need a macro.<p><pre><code>    (define-syntax test (syntax-rules ()\n      ((_ test-expr expected-expr)\n       (let ((tv (call-with-values (lambda () test-expr) list))\n             (ev (call-with-values (lambda () expected-expr) list)))\n         (if (not (equal? tv ev))\n             (printf\n              &quot;\\nTest failed: ~s\\nWanted:      ~s\\nGot:         ~s\\n&quot;\n              &#x27;test-expr\n              ev\n              tv)))))))</code></pre>\n  - **mst** (): Macros are something where usage tends to go<p>1) OMG confusing -&gt; almost never use them\n2) OMG exciting -&gt; use them faaar too much\n3) Huh. Powerful, but so powerful you should use only when required. Cool.<p>Quite a few things turn out to be like that skill-progression-wise and at this point I&#x27;ve just accepted it as human nature.\n"}]}
