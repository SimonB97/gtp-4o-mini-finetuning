And it is available forever. This is known by GitHub, and intentionally designed that way.\\n\\nThis is such an enormous attack vector for all organizations that use GitHub that we’re introducing a new term: **Cross Fork Object Reference (CFOR)**. A CFOR vulnerability occurs when one repository fork can access sensitive data from another fork (including data from private and deleted forks). Similar to an Insecure Direct Object Reference, in CFOR users supply commit hashes to directly access commit data that otherwise would not be visible to them.\\n\\nLet’s see a few examples.\\n\\nAccessing Deleted Fork Data\\n---------------------------\\n\\nConsider this common workflow on GitHub:\\xa0\\n\\n1.  You fork a public repository\\n    \\n2.  You commit code to your fork\\n    \\n3.  You delete your fork\\n    \\n\\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/msknWhH1EkTt7PchLIRCt3npCI.png)\\n\\nIs the code you committed to the fork still accessible? It shouldn’t be, right? You deleted it.\\n\\nIt is. And it’s accessible forever. Out of your control.\\xa0\\n\\nIn the video below, you’ll see us fork a repository, commit data to it, delete the fork, and then access the “deleted” commit data via the original repository.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n**You might think you’re protected by needing to know the commit hash. You’re not. The hash is discoverable. More on that later.**\\n\\n#### How often can we find data from deleted forks?\\n\\nPretty often. We surveyed a few (literally 3) commonly-forked public repositories from a large AI company and easily found 40 valid API keys from deleted forks. The user pattern seemed to be this:\\n\\n1.  Fork the repo.\\n    \\n2.  Hard-code an API key into an example file.\\xa0\\n    \\n3.  <Do Work>\\n    \\n4.  Delete the fork.\\n    \\n      \\n    \\n\\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/CIeHAgW971XDzRy61aiZjY8fBqE.png)\\n\\n  \\n\\n**But this gets worse, it works in reverse too:**\\xa0\\n\\nAccessing Deleted Repo Data\\n---------------------------\\n\\nConsider this scenario:\\n\\n1.  You have a public repo on GitHub.\\n    \\n2.  A user forks your repo.\\n    \\n3.  You commit data after they fork it (and they never sync their fork with your updates).\\n    \\n4.  You delete the entire repo.\\n    \\n      \\n    \\n\\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/A7rA45DJNYSMUEPCF6tj4wilVC0.png)\\n\\nIs the code you committed after they forked your repo still accessible?\\n\\nYep.\\n\\nGitHub stores repositories and forks in a [repository network](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-permissions-and-visibility-of-forks#about-visibility-of-forks)\\n, with the original “upstream” repository acting as the root node. [When a public “upstream” repository that has been forked is “deleted”, GitHub reassigns the root node role to one of the downstream forks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/what-happens-to-forks-when-a-repository-is-deleted-or-changes-visibility#deleting-a-public-repository)\\n. However, all of the commits from the “upstream” repository still exist and are accessible via any fork.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/jCEeyZLP33ugahiS5Oc3N9ms.png)\\n\\n  \\n\\nIn the video below, we create a repo, fork it and then show how data not synced with the fork can still be accessed by the fork after the original repo is deleted.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nThis isn’t just some weird edge case scenario. This unfolded last week:\\n\\n_I submitted a P1 vulnerability to a major tech company showing they accidentally committed a private key for an employee’s GitHub account that had significant access to their entire GitHub organization. They immediately deleted the repository, but since it had been forked, I could still access the commit containing the sensitive data via a fork, despite the fork never syncing with the original “upstream” repository._\\n\\nThe implication here is that any code committed to a public repository may be accessible _forever_ as long as there is at least one fork of that repository.\\n\\n**It gets worse.**\\n\\nAccessing Private Repo Data\\n---------------------------\\n\\nConsider this common workflow for open-sourcing a new tool on GitHub:\\n\\n1.  You create a private repo that will eventually be made public.\\n    \\n2.  You create a private, internal version of that repo (via forking) and commit additional code for features that you’re not going to make public.\\n    \\n3.  You make your “upstream” repository public and keep your fork private.\\n    \\n\\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/xImmfuPpiSy9ttCvAMC5G46bGSk.png)\\n\\nAre your private features and related code (from step 2) viewable by the public?\\n\\nYes. Any code committed between the time you created an internal fork of your tool and when you open-sourced the tool, those commits are accessible on the public repository.\\xa0\\n\\nAny commits made to your private fork _after_ you make the “upstream” repository public are not viewable. That’s because changing the visibility of a private “upstream” repository results in two repository networks - one for the private version, and one for the public version.\\xa0\\n\\n  \\n\\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/zOeORJBOu7eK4cx0y2qdgtXNW4.png)\\n\\nIn the video below, we demonstrate how organizations open-source new tools while maintaining private internal forks, and then show how someone could access commit data from the private internal version via the public one.\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\nUnfortunately, this workflow is one of the most common approaches users and organizations take to developing open-source software. As a result, it’s possible that confidential data and secrets are inadvertently being exposed on an organization's public GitHub repositories.\\n\\n  \\n\\nHow do you actually access the data?\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nBy directly accessing the commit.\\n\\nDestructive actions in GitHub’s repository network (like the 3 scenarios mentioned above) remove references to commit data from the standard GitHub UI and normal git operations. However, this data still exists and is accessible (if you know the commit hash). This is the tie-in between CFOR and IDOR vulnerabilities - if you know the commit hash you can directly access data that is not intended for you.\\n\\nCommit hashes are SHA-1 values.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/EoVCvCLjHvZJCuMrrZ0ZwQd3W8M.png)\\n\\n  \\n\\nIf a user knows the SHA-1 commit hash of a particular commit they want to see, they can directly navigate to that commit at the endpoint: https://github.com`/<user/org>/<repo>/commit/<commit_hash>`. They’ll see a yellow banner explaining that “\\\\[t\\\\]his commit does not belong to any branch of this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.”\\n\\n  \\n\\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/B0wRJU4mjHvmKdy7mpZ3Z3wRV8.png)\\n\\n  \\n\\n**Where do you get these hash values?**\\n\\nCommit hashes can be brute forced through GitHub’s UI, particularly because the git protocol permits the use of [short SHA-1 values](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Revision-Selection#:~:text=to%20any%20commit.-,Short%20SHA%2D1,-Git%20is%20smart)\\n when referencing a commit. A short SHA-1 value is the minimum number of characters required to avoid a collision with another commit hash, with an absolute minimum of 4. The keyspace of all 4 character SHA-1 values is 65,536 (16^4). Brute forcing all possible values can be achieved relatively easily.\\xa0\\n\\nFor example, consider this commit in TruffleHog’s repository:\\n\\n  \\n\\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/yPbRdgv9LoasW1BXLK09dZNMSXs.png)\\n\\n  \\n\\nTo access this commit, users typically visit the URL containing the full SHA-1 commit hash: [https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/commit/07f01e8337c1073d2c45bb12d688170fcd44c637](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/commit/07f01e8337c1073d2c45bb12d688170fcd44c637)\\n\\nBut users don’t need to know the entire 32 character SHA-1 value, they only need to correctly guess the Short SHA-1 value, which in this case is `07f01e`.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/jji5JQSyL5Bh0OJtpMQDB65DE.png)\\n\\n[https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/commit/07f01e](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/commit/07f01e)\\n\\nBut what’s more interesting; GitHub exposes a public events API endpoint. You can also query for commit hashes in the [events archive](https://www.gharchive.org/)\\n which is managed by a 3rd party, and saves all GitHub events for the past decade outside of GitHub, even after the repos get deleted.\\n\\nGitHub’s Policies\\n-----------------\\n\\nWe recently submitted our findings to GitHub via their VDP program. This was their response:\\n\\n  \\n\\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/G9xGKRx7gPHauxianQClKVxPE.png)\\n\\n  \\n\\nAfter reviewing the documentation, it’s clear as day that GitHub designed repositories to work like this.\\xa0\\n\\n  \\n\\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/eE6IuZrodHY2R0pBWcGHKPNxI.png)\\n\\n  \\n\\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/UpywoiGAzxzDtqcMAzLxKeW6dwQ.png)\\n\\n[https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/what-happens-to-forks-when-a-repository-is-deleted-or-changes-visibility](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/what-happens-to-forks-when-a-repository-is-deleted-or-changes-visibility)\\n\\nWe appreciate that GitHub is transparent about their architecture and has taken the time to clearly document what users should expect to happen in the instances documented above.\\xa0\\n\\nOur issue is this:\\n\\nThe average user views the separation of private and public repositories as a security boundary, and understandably believes that any data located in a private repository cannot be accessed by public users. Unfortunately, as we documented above, that is not always true. Whatsmore, the act of deletion implies the destruction of data. As we saw above, deleting a repository or fork does not mean your commit data is actually deleted.\\n\\nImplications\\n------------\\n\\nWe have a few takeaways from this:\\n\\n1.  **As long as one fork exists, any commit to that repository network (ie: commits on the “upstream” repo or “downstream” forks) will exist forever.**\\n    \\n    1.  This further cements our view that the only way to securely remediate a leaked key on a public GitHub repository is through key rotation. We’ve spent a lot of time documenting how to rotate keys for the most popularly leaked secret types - check our work out here: [howtorotate.com](https://howtorotate.com/docs/introduction/getting-started/)\\n        .\\n        \\n\\n2.  GitHub’s repository architecture necessitates these design flaws and unfortunately, the vast **majority of GitHub users will never understand how a repository network actually works and will be less secure** because of it.\\n    \\n\\n3.  As secret scanning evolves, and we can hopefully scan all commits in a repository network, **we’ll be alerting on secrets that might not be our own** (ie: they might belong to someone who forked a repository). This will require more diligent triaging.\\n    \\n      \\n    \\n4.  While these three scenarios are shocking, that doesn’t even cover all of the ways GitHub could be storing deleted data from your repositories. Check out our [recent post](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/trufflehog-scans-deleted-git-branches)\\n     (and related TruffleHog update) about how you also need to scan for secrets in deleted branches.\\xa0\\n    \\n\\nFinally, while our research focused on GitHub, it’s important to note that some of these issues exist on other version control system products.\\n\\n[More from THE DIG](../blog)\\n\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nThoughts, research findings, reports, and more from Truffle Security Co.\\n\\n[![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/QBddtt3Ue3SLvfEshNFBiR49U8I.png)\\\\\\n\\\\\\nJul 24, 2024\\\\\\n\\\\\\n###### Anyone can Access Deleted and Private Repository Data on GitHub](./anyone-can-access-deleted-and-private-repo-data-github)\\n[![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/RzhOgFezeS2FiUsX9xpXnD2FeJk.png)\\\\\\n\\\\\\nJul 19, 2024\\\\\\n\\\\\\n###### Secrets in Source Code Are Not A Code Security Problem](./secrets-are-not-a-code-security-problem)\\n[![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/rrJ69uUorA9UCMKRYcf3E2xo1kc.png)\\\\\\n\\\\\\nJul 10, 2024\\\\\\n\\\\\\n###### Leaked Secrets in Public Jenkins Logs](./leaked-secrets-in-public-jenkins-logs)\\n\\n[T](../blog)\\nhe Dig\\n===================\\n\\nThoughts, research findings, reports, and more from Truffle Security Co.\\n\\n[![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/QBddtt3Ue3SLvfEshNFBiR49U8I.png)\\\\\\n\\\\\\nJul 24, 2024\\\\\\n\\\\\\n###### Anyone can Access Deleted and Private Repository Data on GitHub](./anyone-can-access-deleted-and-private-repo-data-github)\\n[![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/RzhOgFezeS2FiUsX9xpXnD2FeJk.png)\\\\\\n\\\\\\nJul 19, 2024\\\\\\n\\\\\\n###### Secrets in Source Code Are Not A Code Security Problem](./secrets-are-not-a-code-security-problem)\\n\\nSTAY STRONG\\n\\nDIG DEEP\\n\\n[](../)\\n\\nTRUFFLEHOG\\n\\n[TruffleHog open-source](../trufflehog)\\n\\n[TruffleHog enterprise](../trufflehog-enterprise)\\n\\n[Forager](https://forager.trufflesecurity.com/)\\n\\nNEW!\\n\\n[Security](../security)\\n\\n[Integrations](../integrations)\\n\\n[Pricing](../pricing)\\n\\n[CUSTOMERS](../customers)\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\n[About](../about)\\n\\n[Careers](../careers)\\n\\n[Press](../press)\\n\\n[FAQ](../faq)\\n\\n[Contact us](../contact)\\n\\nRESOURCES\\n\\n[Blog](../blog)\\n\\n[Content library](../content-library)\\n\\n[Events](../events)\\n\\n[Videos](../videos)\\n\\n[GitHub](https://github.com/trufflesecurity)\\n\\n[Enterprise docs](https://docs.trufflesecurity.com/)\\n\\n[Open-source docs](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog#trufflehog)\\n\\n[How to rotate](https://howtorotate.com/)\\n\\nNEW!\\n\\nDOING IT THE RIGHT WAY\\n\\nSINCE 2021\\n\\n[](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/)\\n[](https://www.linkedin.com/company/trufflesecurity)\\n[](https://www.youtube.com/@TruffleSecurity)\\n[](https://twitter.com/trufflesec)\\n\\n[#trufflehog-community](https://join.slack.com/t/trufflehog-community/shared_invite/zt-pw2qbi43-Aa86hkiimstfdKH9UCpPzQ)\\n[#Secret Scanning](https://discord.gg/8Hzbrnkr7E)\\n\\n© 2024 Truffle Security Co.\\n\\n[Privacy policy](../privacy-policy)\\n\\n[Terms and conditions](../terms-conditions)\\n\\n[Data processing agreement](../data-processing-agreement)\\n\\n[Acceptable use policy](../acceptable-use-policy)\\n\\nSTAY STRONG\\n\\nDIG DEEP\\n\\n[](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/)\\n[](https://www.linkedin.com/company/trufflesecurity)\\n[](https://www.youtube.com/@TruffleSecurity)\\n[](https://twitter.com/trufflesec)\\n\\n[#trufflehog-community](https://join.slack.com/t/trufflehog-community/shared_invite/zt-pw2qbi43-Aa86hkiimstfdKH9UCpPzQ)\\n[#Secret Scanning](https://discord.gg/8Hzbrnkr7E)\\n\\n© 2024 Truffle Security Co.\\n\\n[Privacy policy](../privacy-policy)\\n\\n[Terms and conditions](../terms-conditions)\\n\\n[Data processing agreement](../data-processing-agreement)\\n\\n[Acceptable use policy](../acceptable-use-policy)\\n\\n-----\\nGenerate comments in a hierarchical structure with 3 comments per level, up to a depth of 3.\"}\n",
      "{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '\\n- **andersa** (): I reported this on their HackerOne many years ago (2018 it seems) and they said it was working as intended. Conclusion: don&#x27;t use private forks. Copy the repository instead.<p>Here is their full response from back then:<p>&gt; Thanks for the submission! We have reviewed your report and validated your findings. After internally assessing the finding we have determined it is a known low risk issue. We may make this functionality more strict in the future, but don&#x27;t have anything to announce now. As a result, this is not eligible for reward under the Bug Bounty program.<p>&gt; GitHub stores the parent repository along with forks in a &quot;repository network&quot;. It is a known behavior that objects from one network member are readable via other network members. Blobs and commits are stored together, while refs are stored separately for each fork. This shared storage model is what allows for pull requests between members of the same network. When a repository&#x27;s visibility changes (Eg. public-&gt;private) we remove it from the network to prevent private commits&#x2F;blobs from being readable via another network member.\\n  - **SnowflakeOnIce** (): There seems to be no such thing as a &quot;private fork&quot; on GitHub in 2024 [1]:<p>&gt; A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the upstream repository. All forks of public repositories are public. You cannot change the visibility of a fork.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;pull-requests&#x2F;collaborating-with-pull-requests&#x2F;working-with-forks&#x2F;about-permissions-and-visibility-of-forks#about-visibility-of-forks\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;pull-requests&#x2F;collaborating-with-...</a>\\n    - **ff7c11** (): A fork of a private repo is private. When you make the original repo public, the fork is still a private repo, but the commits can now be accessed by hash.\\n    - **itsgabriel** (): Funnily enough the docs are wrong, the GitHub CLI allows changing a forks visibility <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;78094654&#x2F;12846952\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;78094654&#x2F;12846952</a>\\n    - **rkagerer** (): Am I the only one who finds this conceptually confusing?\\n  - **liendolucas** (): Honest question. Submitting these types of bugs only to get a: &quot;we have determined it is known low risk issue...&quot; seems like they really don&#x27;t want to pay for someone else&#x27;s time and dedication in making their product safer. If they knew about this, was this disclosed somewhere? If not I don&#x27;t see them playing a fair game. What&#x27;s the motivation to do this if in the end they can have the final decision to award you or not? To me it looks like similar to what happens with Google Play&#x2F;Apple store to decide whether or not an app can be uploaded&#x2F;distributed through them.<p>Edit: I popped this up because to me is absolutely miserable from a big company to just say: &quot;Thanks, but we were aware of this&quot;.\\n    - **jonahx** (): Not defending GH here (their position is indefensible imo) but, as the article notes, they document these behaviors clearly and publicly:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;pull-requests&#x2F;collaborating-with-pull-requests&#x2F;working-with-forks&#x2F;what-happens-to-forks-when-a-repository-is-deleted-or-changes-visibility\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;pull-requests&#x2F;collaborating-with-...</a><p>I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re being underhanded exactly... they&#x27;re just making a terrible decision.  Quoting from the article:<p>&gt; The average user views the separation of private and public repositories as a security boundary, and understandably believes that any data located in a private repository cannot be accessed by public users. Unfortunately, as we documented above, that is not always true. Whatsmore, the act of deletion implies the destruction of data. As we saw above, deleting a repository or fork does not mean your commit data is actually deleted.\\n    - **tptacek** (): No large company running a bug bounty cares one iota about stiffing you on a bounty payment. The teams running this programs are internally incentivized to <i>maximize</i> payouts; the payouts are evidence that the system is working. If you&#x27;re denied a payment --- for a large company, at least --- there&#x27;s something else going on.<p>The thing to keep in mind is that large-scale bug bounty programs make their own incentive weather. People game the hell out of them. If you ack and fix sev:info bugs, people submit <i>lots</i> more sev:info bugs, and now your security program has been reoriented around the dumbest bugs --- the opposite of what you want a bounty program to do.\\n    - **kayodelycaon** (): As the article pointed out, GitHub already publicly documented this vulnerability.<p>My employer doesn&#x27;t pay out for known security issues, especially if we have mitigating controls.<p>A lot of people spam us with vulnerability reports from security tools we already use. At least half of them turn out to be false positives we are already aware of. In my opinion, running a bug bounty program at all is a net negative for us. We aren&#x27;t large enough to get the attention of anyone competent.\\n  - **tedivm** (): I reported a different security issue to github, and they responded the same (although they ultimately ended up fixing it when I told them I was going to blog about the &quot;intended behavior&quot;).\\n    - **myfonj** (): What &quot;intended behaviour&quot; was that, specifically?\\n    - **_heimdall** (): Did you end up getting a bug bounty out of it?\\n- **hackerbirds** (): Users should never be expected to know these gotchas for a feature called &quot;private&quot;, documented or not. It&#x27;s disappointing to see GitHub calling it a feature instead of a bug, to me it just shows a complete lack of care about security. Privacy features should _always_ have a strict, safe default.<p>In the meantime I&#x27;ll be calling &quot;private&quot; repos &quot;unlisted&quot;, seems more appropriate\\n  - **layer8** (): &gt; I&#x27;ll be calling &quot;private&quot; repos &quot;unlisted&quot;<p>The same for “deleted” repos.\\n    - **NullPrefix** (): &quot;deleted&quot; is just a fancy word &quot;inaccessible to the user&quot;\\n  - **chrisandchris** (): Yep, I see GitHub as &quot;public only&quot; hosting, and if I want to host something private, I will choose another vendor.\\n    - **OutOfHere** (): The noted issue looks to be applicable to forks only, not to all private repos.\\n    - **thingification** (): For the benefit of anybody thinking &quot;with gitlab I&#x27;m safe from this&quot;: If you&#x27;re saying (and perhaps you&#x27;re not) that some other git hosting service<p>- gives you control over gc-ing their hosted remote?<p>- does not to your knowledge have a third-party public reflog or an events API or brute-forceable short hashes?<p>if so, especially the second of those seems a fragile assumption, because this is &quot;just&quot; the way git works (I&#x27;m not saying the consequences aren&#x27;t easy to mentally gloss over).  Even if gitlab lacks those things curently (but I think for example it does support short hashes), it&#x27;s easy to imagine them showing up somehow retroactively.<p>If you&#x27;re just agreeing with the grandparent post that github&#x27;s naming (&quot;private&quot;) is misleading or that the fork feature encourages this mistake: agreed.<p>Curious to know if any git hosting service does support gc-ing under user control.\\n    - **account42** (): &gt; if I want to host something private, I will choose another vendor.<p>Or you know, self-host, preferrably on-prem.<p>Basic git hosting only needs a sshd running on the server. If you want collaborative features with a web UI then there are solutions for that available too.\\n  - **catalypso** (): &gt; I&#x27;ll be calling &quot;private&quot; repos &quot;unlisted&quot;<p>That might be a bit too strict. I&#x27;d still expect my private repos (no forks involved) to be private, unless we discover another footnote in GH&#x27;s docs in a few years ¯\\\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯<p>But I&#x27;ll forget about using forks except for publicly contributing to public repos.<p>&gt; Users should never be expected to know these gotchas for a feature called &quot;private&quot;.<p>Yes, the principle of least astonishment[0] should apply to security as well.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Principle_of_least_astonishment\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Principle_of_least_astonishmen...</a>\\n- **hmottestad** (): The biggest gotcha here is probably that if you start of with a private repo and a private fork, making the repo public also makes the fork &quot;public&quot;.<p>GitHub may very well say that this is working as intended, but if it truly is then you should be forced to make both the repo and fork public at the same time.<p>Essentially &quot;Making repo R public will make the following forks public as well &#x27;My Fork&#x27;, &#x27;Super secret fork&#x27;, &#x27;Fork that I deleted because it contained the password to my neighbours wifi :P&#x27;.<p>OK. I&#x27;m not sure if the last one would actually be public, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if that was &quot;Working as intended(TM)&quot; - GitHub SecOps\\n  - **pants2** (): Any time you make a private repo public it’s best to just copy that code into a new public repo and leave the private repo private. Otherwise have to audit every previous commit and every commit on every fork of your private code.\\n    - **umpalumpaaa** (): If I understand the issue correctly if you make the original repo public any private forks from other users are also effectively public. Right?\\n    - **IshKebab** (): Yeah that&#x27;s fine but the issue is GitHub doesn&#x27;t make it clear that you need to do this.\\n  - **kemitche** (): I agree. The other cases may be mildly surprising, but ultimately fall firmly into the category of &quot;once public on the internet, always public.&quot; Deleting a repo or fork or commit doesn&#x27;t revoke an access key that was accidentally committed, and an access key being public for even a microsecond should be assumed to have been scraped and usable by a malicious actor.\\n    - **hmottestad** (): If you have a private repo, you would assume that nothing in that private repo becomes public unless you do something very explicit.<p>The issue here is that if you have a private repo and a private fork of that repo. If you make the private repo public and keep the fork private, then you are not explicitly told that your fork is actually public, whether you want to or not.\\n  - **Already__Taken** (): it&#x27;s a bit of that you have to know the sha, and that&#x27;s quite unique. it&#x27;s apparently unique enough for Google photos to &quot;private&quot; share without logins\\n    - **Shocka1** (): You only need the short SHA, which is 4 characters. Brute force ends up becoming very easy with 65k possibilities.\\n'}\n"

       "\n",
       "3.  As secret scanning evolves, and we can hopefully scan all commits in a repository network, **we’ll be alerting on secrets that might not be our own** (ie: they might belong to someone who forked a repository). This will require more diligent triaging.\n",

       "      \n",

It is a known behavior that objects from one network member are readable via other network members. Blobs and commits are stored together, while refs are stored separately for each fork. This shared storage model is what allows for pull requests between members of the same network. When a repository&#x27;s visibility changes (Eg. public-&gt;private) we remove it from the network to prevent private commits&#x2F;blobs from being readable via another network member.\n",

       "In diesem Artikel demonstrieren wir die Anwendbarkeit von Deep Learning für die Anomalieerkennung in Bildern. Unser Ziel ist es, mit Hilfe von Neuronalen Netzen mögliche Fehler am Aufbau eines Vespa-Modells aus Klemmbausteinen zu erkennen.\n",
       "\n",
       "Bei der Erkennung von Anomalien handelt es sich um die Bestimmung von Abweichungen oder Unregelmäßigkeiten in den Daten, die nicht dem erwarteten Muster oder Verhalten entsprechen. Das ist eine wichtige Aufgabe in vielen Bereichen wie Betrugsprävention, Systemüberwachung und Qualitätssicherung.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mit diesem Use Case adressieren wir Explainable AI und machen unser System für die Anwender verständlich. Zudem stärken wir das Vertrauen in KI-Lösungen, die für Außenstehende oftmals wie eine Art Blackbox wirken.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Der erste Ansatz\n",
       "\n",
       "Zuerst verwendeten wir einen Autoencoder, eine Art neuronales Netz, das Eingabedaten komprimiert und rekonstruiert. Anomalien können erkannt werden, indem man den Rekonstruktionsfehler misst, der die Diskrepanz zwischen Eingabe und rekonstruiertem Ausgang darstellt. Instanzen mit hohen Rekonstruktionsfehlerwerten sind wahrscheinlich Anomalien. In unserem Blog-Artikel [KI-gestützte Fehlererkennung bei einem Vespa-Modell](https://www.atr-software.de/ki-gestuetzte-fehlererkennung-bei-einem-vespa-modell-aus-lego/)\n",
       " erklären wir die Funktionsweise genauer. Obwohl mit Autoencodern schon gute Ergebnisse erzielt werden können, sind in jüngster Vergangenheit einige noch fortschrittlichere, komplexere KI-Architekturen entwickelt worden. Diese bauen auf dem gleichen Prinzip auf, haben es aber weiter optimiert. Deshalb testeten und verglichen wir viele dieser neuen Ansätze für unseren Anwendungsfall. \n",

       "### Optimierung des Modells\n",
       "\n",
       "Wir entschieden uns für Reverse Distillation in Kombination mit One-Class Bottleneck Embedding (OCBE), um eine bessere Effizienz und Effektivität zu erreichen. Diese Methode liefert eine sehr gut interpretierbare Darstellung der Daten und ermöglicht eine verbesserte Generalisierung für unbekannte Anomalien. Stark vereinfacht ausgedrückt erreicht sie diese bessere Performance durch das Vergleichen von Input und Output, ähnlich dem Prinzip eines Autoencoders. Jedoch findet dies auf verschiedenen Stufen der Codierung und Decodierung der Daten gleichzeitig statt. Ähnlich vielversprechende Ergebnisse ließen sich mit der PatchCore-Architekur erreichen, die sich auf die Rekonstruktion lokaler Patches konzentriert und somit kleinere lokale Anomalien besser erkennen kann\n",
       "\n",
       "![Heatmap und Segmentierung generiert von Reverse Distillation-Model](https://www.atr-software.de/www.atr-software.de/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif%20%22Heatmap_und_Segmentierung_Vespa_Reverse_Distillation_Model%22)\n",

       "_Heatmap und Segmentierung generiert von Reverse Distillation-Model_ \n",
       "\n",
       "Anschließend optimierten wir unser Modell mit Methoden wie der Kreuzvalidierung, die wir während der Auswahl der besten Architektur und Parameter verwendeten, um besonders das häufige Problem von Overfitting zu vermeiden. Mithilfe von Transfer Learning konnten wir Gebrauch von sehr leistungsstarken, auf riesigen Datenmengen trainierten Bild-Klassifizierungs-Modellen machen, um die Anzahl der benötigten Trainingsdaten möglichst gering zu halten. \n",
       "\n",
       "Nach sorgfältiger Anpassung unseres Modells auf die in Blender modellierten 3D-Grafiken testeten wir es mit Fotos der realen Lego-Vespa. Dabei bemerkten wir, dass Unterschiede in der Beleuchtung bei der Datenaufnahme das Modell verwirren können, ein Phänomen, das als Verteilungsdrift bekannt ist. \n",

       "Um diese Herausforderung zu meistern, haben wir in unserer Showcase-Installation ein starkes Studiolicht eingesetzt. Dies führte zu einer gleichmäßigen Beleuchtung und minimierte die Missinterpretationen des Modells.\n",
       "\n",
       "Abschließend konnten wir erfolgreich demonstrieren, dass KI-gestützte Bildanalyse effektiv zur Erkennung und Lokalisierung von Anomalien im Aufbau von Lego-Vespa-Modellen eingesetzt werden kann. Trotz einiger Herausforderungen, wie der Bewältigung von Verteilungsdrift durch Beleuchtungsunterschiede, zeigt unsere Arbeit das immense Potenzial von Deep Learning in der Qualitätssicherung und Anomalieerkennung. Es bleibt jedoch ein fortlaufender Prozess, die Modelle weiter zu optimieren und an spezifische Anwendungsfälle anzupassen. \n",

       "- **mouseskate** (): Great application of Machine Learning.<p>In addition to learning how to apply ML in practice, it also addresses some of its besetting challenges:<p>- Explainable AI/understanding your model: this proof of principle gives us human-understandable outputs of the model, which goes some way in addressing the concerns around AI being a black box<p>- ML monitoring needs: I would bet that a major area of cost with deployment of ML is monitoring model runtime performance and retraining when a model &quot;ages-out&quot; by obtaining reduced accuracy over time (as it sees new, unseen data). This example shows a potential method for doing just that, by performing anomaly detection on its inputs.<p>At my company we realised years ago that we needed to build anomaly detection into our product (as part of our Monitoring module), and it turned into a very big and complex project. I now see there are probably several pre-trained ML models we could leverage using tools like this.<p>I am now wondering if the converse is handled as well with this project: i.e. had the model seen the real-world image of the vespa without a missing part in its training data, would it have been sufficiently well trained to recognise the real-world image as normal (and therefore not an anomaly)?\n",

A certain correlation of pixels in a certain size box means this LEGO part is here, there, or not at all.  A certain other correlation of pixels within the same sized box means that other LEGO part is there, here, or not at all.  What makes it be faced-out vs. faced-in is the faceout vs.-in facing it has of the base, plus pixel-by-correlated-pixel mapping of that facings&#x27;s XYZ planar-distance-from-camera for how-near/clumpy it is of those 2 disprovers.  The way it knows the XY geometries of pixel-location-XY-to-real-or-net-XY-dimension of all these brick part-demention-disposition-XYZ-non-holograms, is the onetime training it got from 2D-&gt;3D-aware video preparation.  Rinse repeat.<p>In the end, it knows basically nothing abstract about these parts and their contingencies, or how to else-denominate  them.
